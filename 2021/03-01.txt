Help, I think I'm stuck in a loop between "error: comptime control flow inside runtime block" (on 'continue') and "error: unable to evaluate constant expression" on the 'for'.

1614557238
kbd
will post gist

1614557449
kbd


1614557505
kbd
this is the thing from the other day where I had to change tuples to structs because the former was comptime. So I'd expect the for loop to not be 'inline'

1614557539
g-w1
use inline for

1614557564
g-w1
i think it should work

1614557595
kbd
inline for gives the first of the errors on the 'continue'

1614557603
kbd
"comptime control flow inside runtime block"

1614557607
g-w1
ah you want const format

1614557698
g-w1
but continues inside inline for doesn't work hmm

1614557698
kbd
ah. Hmm, changed "var format" to "const format", "for" to "inline for", and I'm still getting " error: comptime control flow inside runtime block" on the (second) continue

1614557747
g-w1
is there some way you can not use continue?

1614557831
kbd
yeah, apply more structured programming. Will try.

1614557919
g-w1
this is definently a bug in stage1, idk how easy to fix

1614557920
kbd
yep that gets passed it using flags.

1614557932
g-w1
flags?

1614557939
kbd
I'll post the updated code one sec

1614557951
g-w1
k

1614558124
kbd
oh it's still buggy anyway, lemme get the code to actually work. My point about flags was that any 'continue' can be turned into a flag (like "skip"), where the rest of the block is guarded by an "if skip".

1614558154
g-w1
ah yep, makes sense

1614558185
kbd
maybe that's not true in general, not sure. But in my case where the continue is at the tail of each branch I think it holds.

1614558240
kbd
sorry, "if ( ! skip)"

1614558393
kbd
what's the easiest way to format an integer into a string? The function I was looking at has five parameters.

1614558431
kbd
like should I bufPrint it into a string that I know is long enough?

1614558543
g-w1
std.fmt.formatInt

1614558548
g-w1
or just bufPrint

1614558615
kbd
ok I didn't understand what to use for the 'writer' on formatInt, lemme look at the stdlib again.

1614558644
g-w1
just use bufPrint if you know the length

1614558814
kbd
32 bit number is max 10 digits if I counted correctly. But ok, no simpler version of formatInt that I missed, thanks. Cause I look at the writer in the stdlib to try to figure out what it is and it's "anytype" 🤦‍♂️

1614558953
g-w1
it is something that impliments std.io.writer

1614558985
g-w1
generics in zig are kind of hard to reason about because anytype

1614559115
g-w1
*not generics per-se but traits

1614559159
mipri
it's static but it's still duck typing, yeah? documentation will help, and maybe some tooling to show you what the anytype looks like according to callers.

1614559222
g-w1
i think it can be accomplished with some language features to make traits like this

1614559250
g-w1
imo its best to implement something in the language, you shouldn't need docs to tell you something as basic as what to pass to a function

1614559342
mipri
this is already a hard requirement for something like a format string.

1614559390
g-w1
yeah, but i feel like there is a way to do some sort of trait thing at comptime that can better tell you the type in the signature of the function

1614559407
mipri
although I was thinking of the var arguments that go with it, first.

1614559418
daurnimator
kbd: indeed `continue` is broken inside of comptime loops

1614559429
daurnimator
we've had to work around that in the standard library in a few places

1614559473
daurnimator
also watch out for using `break` or `switch` inside of comptime loops

1614559508
daurnimator
or even `return` inside of a comptime loop... which includes `try`

1614559521
kbd
So the loop should automatically turn into a runtime loop if it uses runtime features, but it doesn't?

1614559529
g-w1
is this a language flaw, or a impl flaw?

1614559540
daurnimator
g-w1: impl.

1614559544
daurnimator


1614559548
g-w1
ok

1614559793
kbd
This worked, no continues:

1614561628
kbd


1614561743
kbd
dang that was the main thing I was looking forward to (the async/await) in my Zig implementation.

1614562243
daurnimator
kbd: I'm not sure what code you're trying with?

1614562279
kbd
sure lemme produce a test case

1614562341
kbd
figured maybe y'all would respond with the github issue I ran into

1614562876
kbd


1614562914
kbd
I quickly stripped down my main code into that, but that reproduces.

1614563048
kbd
that complies and runs without the 'pub const io_mode = .evented'

1614563171
kbd
bbiab

1614563294
daurnimator
kbd: trying to compile that I get "child_process.zig:474:17: error: missing std lib enhancement: ChildProcess implementation has no way to collect the environment variables to forward to the child process"

1614563491
g-w1
i get the broken llvm module on latest zig

1614565954
mikdusan
heh I was looking at which procs use compressed memory and a bunch of `llvm-tblgen` came up. From yesterday when I

1614565967
mikdusan
that it left a dozen zombie processes

1614571153
andrewrk
mikdusan, huh I wonder what caused those processes to become zombies

1614571167
andrewrk
in theory if the parent is killed the children should be killed too right?

1614571207
andrewrk
hmm I searched for "abort child processes" and did not get the results I expected

1614571300
andrewrk
mikdusan, the script works on master branch if you comment out csky and handle the fact that some TuneFeatures are empty (handle the optional instead of .?)

1614572820
daurnimator
andrewrk: no, if parent are killed then children get reparented to PID 1

1614572851
andrewrk
that is not a desirable default

1614572866
daurnimator
tell the designers back in the 80s

1614572869
daurnimator
uh, 70s

1614572877
andrewrk
I'd rather just set a flag to change things, is there one?

1614572893
daurnimator
its platform dependant

1614572927
daurnimator
but hey, it's one of those times I actually changed posix :)

1614573070
daurnimator
andrewrk: oh, and it also depends on all the programs you

1614573084
daurnimator
which are even more platform dependant that process groups

1614573089
daurnimator
s/that/than/

1614573122
andrewrk
I don't really care about posix, we can always put comptime logic to switch on the target

1614573151
andrewrk
the behavior was observed on linux

1614573181
daurnimator
e.g. back in 2017 I asked netbsd and they said they wouldn't implement the options unless posix mandated it.

1614573274
kbd
is there any trick for using iterators to pass them to things like std.mem.join or sort? Trying to join the values of BufSet. Get the iterator, add them to an ArrayList, and take the .items?

1614573287
kbd
(to pass to .join)

1614581222
mikdusan
andrewrk: trivial PR for llvm12: #8105

1614582003
mikdusan
thanks for "update to LLVM 12 sret callsite requirements" commit!

1614582453
andrewrk
np

1614582458
andrewrk
thx for the usage fix

1614584035
semarie
andrewrk: how often is updated zig-bootstrap ?

1614584121
andrewrk
hi semarie! it's updated when llvm releases and when zig releases

1614584139
andrewrk
I'd be happy to do an update right now for llvm12rc2 and zig llvm12 branch

1614584157
andrewrk
for 0.7.1 you can check out the git tag of the repo

1614586062
andrewrk
semarie, done. master branch of zig-bootstrap is updated to latest zig llvm12 branch, and llvm 12 rc2

1614586079
andrewrk
there are a number of issues with llvm 12 that are not resolved yet

1614586760
mikdusan
andrewrk: you mentioned a thing you do with every zig llvm update, 24 hours, what does that process entail?

1614586860
mikdusan
is it `zig build test` w/ llvm debug binaries or something more?

1614586868
andrewrk
yes it's that

1614586874
andrewrk
takes a long time to complete

1614586894
mikdusan
just checking, are you aware that release can be built with same asserts enabled?

1614586929
TheLemonMan
yo

1614586940
mikdusan
hi lemon

1614586974
TheLemonMan
re: the debug info problem, did you manage to reproduce it with LLVM12?

1614586986
mikdusan
getting close. I've got it down to 10 megabyte .ll

1614587020
mikdusan
and now am setting up an llvm `opt` that uses -O1 passes and will add 1 by 1 each -O2 pass difference until it poops

1614587025
TheLemonMan
you can use llvm-reduce to perform the reduction for you

1614587118
TheLemonMan
I usually perform a binary search, run opt with every pass and then remove half of them

1614587143
mikdusan
ok so I have a 10 meg .ll which has been optimized and can reproduce every time these 2 things:

1614587169
mikdusan
llc against .ll crashes. and opt --strip other.ll,  llc never crashes.

1614587181
mikdusan
I'll give reduce a shot right now

1614587698
mikdusan
ugh not getting how to use this thing

1614587823
TheLemonMan
yeah, there are little to no docs, check out this video

1614587832
mikdusan
thanks

1614587832
TheLemonMan
2:02 shows how it works

1614588446
mikdusan
go go gadget

1614588859
mikdusan
down to 1.2M reduced.ll so looks like progress

1614589330
TheLemonMan
now that's what I call weight loss

1614589443
mikdusan
github doesn't like .xz for shame.

1614589776
mikdusan
TheLemonMan: updated #6408

1614590125
TheLemonMan
submitted a patch for the miscompilation

1614590133
mikdusan
llvm-reduce managed to get it down to 200 KB . pretty impressive

1614590200
mikdusan
90% of that is debug meta

1614590612
TheLemonMan
we should split #6480 into two tickets, the miscompilation is unrelated to the debug assertion problem

1614590618
mikdusan
I agree

1614590637
mikdusan
I'll do that

1614590881
mikdusan
this title ok? `llvm12: -OReleaseFast miscompilation of lib.std.fs.path.extension()`

1614590917
TheLemonMan
yeah

1614591028
TheLemonMan
the debug problem is linked to the tokens_copy being defined twice

1614591055
TheLemonMan
same file, same line, different scope

1614591106
TheLemonMan
as expected it's because of the `inline for`

1614591257
TheLemonMan
fs.path.extension should use lastIndexOfScalar instead of lastIndexOf, that'd make it slightly faster than it already is

1614591959
mikdusan
heh crossed my wires on those two issues. fixed now.

1614592150
mikdusan
so debug issue is basically comment #8 here:

1614592189
mikdusan
well maybe not alloca-related. i haven't checked details enough.

1614592244
mikdusan
more recent one:

1614592328
TheLemonMan
check out the unoptimized .ll file, do you see the same declaration for `tokens_copy` (from json.zig) ?

1614592484
mikdusan
grep tokens_copy a2.ll  | grep dec

1614592486
mikdusan
call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata %TokenStream* %tokens_copy, metadata !9959, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !9973

1614592488
mikdusan
call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata %TokenStream* %tokens_copy22, metadata !9959, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !9973

1614592490
mikdusan
call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata %TokenStream* %tokens_copy25, metadata !9959, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !9973

1614592611
TheLemonMan
can you upload the reduced unoptimized .ll file too? I'll check if some optimization pass is mishandling the debug infos

1614592615
mikdusan
yup

1614592754
mikdusan
added to comment

1614592823
mikdusan
it manifested somewhere between opt --O1 and --O2

1614592931
TheLemonMan
you can try to pinpoint the offending passes with llvm's bugpoint

1614597048
ikskuh
TheLemonMan: answering here to prevent spam:

1614597055
ikskuh
even then LLVM is not doing what i'm asking for:

1614597063
ikskuh
it's not setting rbx, but bl

1614597070
ikskuh
which has very different semantics

1614597528
TheLemonMan
the type itself decides what part of the register is updated, this behaviour is the same in C asm expressions (IIRC)

1614597738
ikskuh
hm

1614597752
ikskuh
then i consider this a footgun and should yield an error instead of silently emitting broken code

1614597829
TheLemonMan
I guess this is only a problem on architectures with "register views" (x86 and aarch64)

1614597847
ikskuh
yeah, but it's still a problem

1614597870
ikskuh
asm volatile("":: [_] "{rbx}" (@as(u1, 1)):);

1614597888
ikskuh
this is looking like it's setting rbx, but it's actually not setting rbx

1614597891
ikskuh
thus: footgun/bug imho

1614598380
TheLemonMan
yeah, that's definitely something the compiler should catch

1614599404
mikdusan
am I using `llc` wrong? if I can do this:

1614599439
mikdusan
`opt -O3 -S unoptimized.ll > optimized.ll; llc optimized.ll [SEGFAULT]`

1614599446
mikdusan
but this:

1614599457
mikdusan
`llc -O3 unoptimized.ll` does not segfault

1614599491
TheLemonMan
try adding -filetype asm

1614599520
mikdusan
no diff

1614599669
TheLemonMan
hmm, check if the optimization pipelines are the same (pass -debug-pass=Arguments to check them)

1614599711
mikdusan
ah. they're quite different

1614602845
mikdusan
trigger for the debug-info assert:

1614602847
mikdusan
opt -inline -sroa -S _unoptimized.ll > _custom.ll

1614602849
mikdusan
llc _custom.ll

1614625741
andrewrk
howdy TheLemonMan, thanks for the help recently troubleshooting our llvm 12 woes

1614625764
TheLemonMan
hiya, gotta get everything lined up and ready for the release

1614625910
TheLemonMan
if you have some spare cycles for #8007 I'll rebase it

1614626123
g-w1
its not in the parser, its in fmt

1614626159
ifreund
you sure? gdb lead me to believe otherwise

1614626197
g-w1
it just throws a parse error for me

1614626236
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, even C printf gets x/X. how come we don't get it in zig?

1614626277
andrewrk
oh I see, you made it not ambiguous, so it only works for integers

1614626300
andrewrk
ok, I'm game to merge it

1614626409
TheLemonMan
x/X on slices of u8 prints the usual { 0x.., 0x.., ... }, you can get the "condensed" hex format with the supplied formatters

1614626419
TheLemonMan
cool, I'll rebase it asap

1614626456
TheLemonMan
g-w1, the error is in the stage2 parser used by zig fmt

1614626491
g-w1
yep, I realized that :/

1614626520
ifreund
found it :)

1614626576
TheLemonMan
the tok_i -= 1 part is fishy

1614626593
TheLemonMan
and there are many occurrences of that

1614626622
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, it's part of the new strategy, the parser does less work and later you have to poke around the token_tags array to find information about the AST

1614626657
TheLemonMan
yeah, but the loop is now doing nextToken() -> tok_i -= 1

1614626668
TheLemonMan
it gets stuck in the loop for the time being

1614626702
ifreund
yeah I think it's wrong in this case, removing it doesn't cause any tests to fail

1614626725
ifreund
I'll try and add a test case for the desired recoverability in this situation

1614626757
TheLemonMan
look out for some other nextToken/tok_i-=1 pairs, I noticed at least two or three of them

1614628300
marler8997
g-w1, hey have you tried looking at that opensslstatic issue?  I don't want to deploy binaries until we figure out why it isn't working on your machine

1614628405
g-w1
not yet, zigup works, just not google

1614628415
g-w1
ill debug more later

1614628939
g-w1
is anyone familiar with how the cbe allocates memory?

1614629023
g-w1
try bw.writeAll("typedef struct { "); try dg.renderType(bw, child_type); try bw.writeAll(" payload; uint16_t error; } "); this is weird, im only getting a leak on the third write

1614629112
ifreund
did you try valgrind yet?

1614629123
g-w1
no, i thought the gpa was enough; is it not?

1614629185
ifreund
I don't know, personally I'd give valgrind a try. It has saved me countless hours of debugging

1614629236
g-w1
also when I run it on the cli its doesn't leak, only in the test harness. something is fishy

1614629333
andrewrk
valgrind has a lot to offer zig programs because it will catch branch on undefined value, and zig has valgrind integration to mark `undefined` stuff

1614629363
g-w1
it did catch something :)

1614629369
andrewrk
gpa provides leak checking and a certain kind of memory safety but it will not catch branch on undefined

1614629442
g-w1


1614629450
g-w1
i used valgrind -s, never used b4

1614629456
g-w1
this is w/o -s

1614629516
g-w1
seems like something is undefined

1614629547
andrewrk
g-w1, that's not catching anything, you'd be better to run without valgrind in this case to get the stack trace that zig is failing to print there

1614629617
g-w1


1614629654
g-w1
ig ill try to figure out how the writer allocates

1614629721
g-w1
it seems like its just the gpa

1614629762
ifreund1
g-w1: did you push your code yet?

1614629899
g-w1
these 2 commits:

1614629921
g-w1
its probably something stupid :)

1614630890
ifreund
g-w1: I think the issue is your `     typedefs.clearRetainingCapacity();` call

1614630902
ifreund
you don't free the owned rendered slices stored in the map

1614630939
ifreund
(this is in updateDecl()

1614630978
g-w1
ah, thanks

1614631154
g-w1
ah, it was probably the case since the test harness uses the same module? its always fun debugging code you didn't write but suspecting you wrote the bug

1614631312
ifreund
gotta get more paranoid :P

1614632106
ifreund
TheLemonMan: did a quick pass over std/zig/parse.zig but didn't find any other `p.tok_i -= 1; p.nextToken();` loops :)

1614632348
TheLemonMan
yay, no more infinite loops

1614633349
andrewrk
brilliant

1614633372
andrewrk
and thanks to FireFox317 we got zig-bootstrap up to speed with llvm12 branch

1614636643
ed_t
think I have a compiler bug, which occurs in both 0.71 and 0.80git (from friday).

1614636697
ed_t
I've posted info in zig-help on the 'zig programming language' discord

1614636874
ed_t


1614636928
ed_t
the while loop at line 65 exits even though the previous print shows c.in as false, which should mean it suspends
