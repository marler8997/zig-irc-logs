marler8997
so, is "--strip" the opposite of "-g" in gcc?

1566261444
daurnimator
marler8997: I think zig always emits debug info; and then removes it from the linker.

1566261515
daurnimator
I thought there was an issue open about not generating it in the first place; but I can't find it....

1566261629
scientes
there isn't much of a use case for that besides 1) being a little faster, 2) creating easier-to-read llvmir-

1566261648
scientes
anyways, that is my opinion

1566261672
marler8997
I'm just trying to translate GCC command-line to the equivalent zig command-line

1566261721
daurnimator
marler8997: --strip is more the equivalent of -Wl,--strip-debug

1566261734
marler8997
ok

1566261744
marler8997
any idea if there is an equivalent for -g?

1566261761
daurnimator
-g is the default in zig and can't be turned off

1566262315
marler8997
next step is to be able to invoke the C preprocessor

1566262362
marler8997
I think in general, I'm going to need the ability to invoke clang, except after libc is built and with the arguments that are required to include it

1566262379
daurnimator
marler8997: like via `zig cc`?

1566262397
marler8997
"except after libc is built and with the arguments that are required to include it"

1566262409
marler8997
clang+libc

1566262842
marler8997
looks like there is a "zig libc" command, but it doesn't seem to print the same paths that I see when compiling C code with --verbose-cc

1566262909
daurnimator
marler8997: zig libc is more like a couple of select pieces of `gcc -dumpspecs`

1566262948
marler8997
I've got a bunch of different ideas to get this to work but I'm just not sure the right path at this point

1566262965
marler8997
The end goal is to be able to call zig like it's a normal C compiler

1566262992
marler8997
I wrote a small tool that will translate basic options to zig...but now I need to be able to inoke the preprocess (-E)

1566262999
daurnimator
marler8997: have you looked at the implementation of std/build's addCSource?

1566263049
marler8997
I've looked at what the compiler does when C files are added to the command-line.  I assume it's the same result

1566263101
daurnimator
marler8997: note that your "c compiler" like gcc/clang is several tools in one: it's a preprocessor, compiler, linker and more: it's probably useful to break down the operations as such.

1566263120
marler8997
right, I'm at the preprocessor point right now

1566263137
daurnimator
marler8997: so trying to map `gcc -E` invocations?

1566263142
marler8997
right now yes

1566263163
marler8997
but it seems to me that the simplest way to support all the options would be to have a way to invoke zig's clang with libc

1566263176
marler8997
And then I can provide any clang options I want, along with the options for libc

1566263192
marler8997
Or if there was a way I could pull the libc options from zig

1566263224
marler8997
I could run a simple "build-exe" and "build-obj" and read/parse the options from zig's output

1566263251
marler8997
I think that would work, but I dont' want to go implement it since I'm sure there's something simpler

1566263372
marler8997
And if I did implement that, I would probably just run the compiler before every command, enable a "dry-run" mode where it doesn't generate any output, and then re-invoke it with the command-line I got and any options I want to add

1566263481
marler8997
another idea is to add a "--c-args" where zig adds those arguments to any clang invocations

1566263697
fengb
Is there a way to make a hybrid slice / ArrayList?

1566264227
fengb
Bleh I think I need a separate context to build the slice

1566270311
bgiannan
is there a way to import c macros too?

1566272811
daurnimator
bgiannan: at the moment

1566272824
daurnimator
bgiannan: IIRC you can use --verbose-cimport to get a list of untranslateables

1566272864
bgiannan
ok. i ended up rewrite the equivalent in zig.

1566272906
bgiannan
Following the point 2 at

1566272943
fengb
Yes, Zig doesn't have a general allocator yet

1566273118
daurnimator
bgiannan: yep. you can use the C heap allocator for now. one day we'll have our own....

1566273136
daurnimator
fengb: btw how did you go with your allocator. it was you I was teaching about allocators right?

1566273145
fengb
Yeah, it works™

1566273157
fengb


1566273160
fengb
Test case of 1

1566273222
daurnimator
I should try and pick up my allocator again. I got sad by mismatches between C and zig allocation apis which means you actually need a worst-of-both-worlds approach

1566273274
daurnimator
(for C allocators you have a known max alignment but don't get the length passed in; for zig you get the length passed in but it can be any run-time alignment)

1566273286
fengb
I made some concessions. I have a TODO for allowing 16 bit+ alignment, but it works well enough(?) and it's much smaller than dlmalloc

1566273335
fengb
I adopted metadata right before the memory, which is where 8 bit alignment is stuck

1566273364
daurnimator
I got distracted trying to optimize for high alignment small size items.... and then went off and worked on other things

1566273365
fengb
(8 bit on wasm32)

1566273387
daurnimator
fengb: indeed. the problem with metadata before the memory is that you end up wasting.... a lot

1566273427
daurnimator
though in practice its safer....

1566273443
daurnimator
because people are much more likely to overrun the end of an allocation than use the area before

1566273462
fengb
Hmm I never thought about that

1566273566
daurnimator
With all these limitations I ended up thinking "I should just do it with a prefix tree instead"

1566273579
daurnimator
but then I thought "prefix trees are gnarly with threads; I should use a maple tree instead"

1566273590
daurnimator
and then I never wrote the maple tree implementation.

1566273605
fengb
Well I'm glad I don't care about threads or performance :P

1566273607
daurnimator
partially because there is no userspace RCU with a liberal license

1566273619
daurnimator
and so I went off to shave the RCU yak

1566274065
fengb
Would it be worthwhile to port an existing allocator like dlmalloc or (sounds scary) jemalloc?

1566274393
daurnimator
fengb: I don't think so. they don't allow the arbitrary alignment that zig does....

1566274421
daurnimator
nor do they usually allow multiple allocators in a single process

1566274449
daurnimator
I should just finish my "classic allocator" and put the metadata at the end

1566274453
daurnimator
so we have

1566274545
fengb
I suppose I could try adopting mine to be more general purpose

1566274678
fengb
Damnit, nrdmn added my silly protobuf experiment. I was actually planning on punting on that because I can't do what I wanted :(

1566275407
daurnimator
fengb: huh? added what where?

1566275444
fengb


1566276332
hspak
anyone have a good resource for operations like 'ls' and 'cd' in zig? it's not super obvious to me from digging in the std lib

1566276900
hspak
found walkPath, looks like that's what I'm looking for

1566277213
hspak
interesting zig has an assert on paths that end in '/'

1566277703
daurnimator
hspak: generally you should never need to `cd`... it's a bit of an antipattern

1566277792
daurnimator
hspak: but yes; for `ls` see std.fs.Dir and iterate with .next()

1566277836
daurnimator
hspak: note that walkPath is recursive (`ls` isn't)

1566278114
hspak
daurnimator:  I see, thanks for the pointers!

1566280244
bgiannan
I have a strange compile error: expected type '*.cimport:2:13.struct_SDL_Renderer', found '*.cimport:2:13.struct_

1566280245
bgiannan
SDL_Renderer'

1566280265
bgiannan
complains that i give A when it expected... A

1566282055
bgiannan
i was doing 2 cImport of sdl

1566284101
bgiannan
is there a for loop in the classical sense? `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...` ? I only see example of `for` over an array/slice

1566284536
bgiannan
if i understand the doc correctly, `for`  is only used to iterate over array and slices so i should use `while`

1566284562
daurnimator
bgiannan: that's correct

1566284577
bgiannan
ah there's a continue expression

1566284597
bgiannan
so should be:  `var i = 0; while (i < 10) : i += 1 {...}`

1566284600
bgiannan
?

1566284617
daurnimator
yep. but you'll still need to declare your loop variable. `var i = usize(0); while (i < 10) : (i += 1) { .... }`

1566284630
daurnimator
note that you need parenthesis for the continue expression

1566284640
daurnimator
also that you'll need to pick the variable type of the index

1566284913
bgiannan
so there's no default arguments and i can define the same functions with different arguments either? do i have to declare several functions with different names which provide the default values?

1566284954
daurnimator
yes

1566284992
bgiannan
or maybe i could make those arguments optional? i would have to pass null but at least i'm not redefining X functions

1566285028
daurnimator
if you want to, sure

1566286813
bgiannan
i do i get the size of an array?

1566286877
gonz_
`array.len`

1566286893
bgiannan
thx

1566287554
gonz_
I realize now that wasn't really an answer to getting the size, but I hope it made sense

1566295407
bgiannan
how do i print a string when its a [*]const u8 (coming from C)?

1566296008
tiehuis
bgiannan: use '{s}' to print a null-terminated pointer/string

1566296016
bgiannan
ah thx

1566308741
fengb
Is there a way to add a declaration to a struct at comptime?

1566308983
scientes
fengb, you can have two versions of the struct chosen at comptime

1566308997
scientes
yeah, you could probably do that

1566309005
scientes
oh, except its a const

1566309023
scientes
and it kinda has to be a const

1566309033
scientes
because other code gen depends on the way the struct is layed out

1566309066
fengb
I need a separate struct declaration not a field. I want to add a "tag" to a struct

1566309123
scientes
yeah i don't know what you mean by tag

1566309213
fengb


1566309234
fengb
Only needed for comptime reflection uses

1566309258
scientes
that would be really problematic to implement

1566309269
scientes
because you are creating dependency issues

1566309274
scientes
reading is fine

1566309279
scientes
but writing is complicated

1566309282
fengb
Alright

1566309298
fengb
My other solution is shove the number into the type when I create it. It's less elegant but that's fine

1566309320
scientes
if we want a comptime database, then create a comptime database

1566309386
fengb
It's just to emulate Go tags or Java annotations

1566309421
fengb
I mean, yes I'll create a comptime lookup of sorts, but this localizes the data so I don't have to cross reference it

1566309478
scientes
oh weird

1566309482
scientes


1566309571
fengb
Yeah they're just reflection data that has no natural code meaning

1566309594
scientes
I get the use case, but I'm not sure its worth it

1566309608
scientes
it seems like an abuse of a turing complete language

1566309609
fengb
Useful for thinks like serialization:

1566309619
scientes
that such data should be in a non-turing complete language

1566309637
fengb
Then this generated code would be hideous

1566309653
fengb
Again, I can create a manual mapper, but then it'd be write-only

1566309685
fengb
I really just need the field number. Zig represents everything else pretty well

1566309713
scientes
well if we had comptime file handling, then you could even write your own parser

1566309728
scientes
maybe....

1566309729
fengb
I plan on doing that too

1566309736
fengb
But I still like the generated code to be readable

1566309759
scientes
then just name the fields by the name of the tag

1566309767
fengb
The field number is the problem

1566309775
scientes
the number could be the name

1566309782
fengb
But then it's not named

1566309790
fengb
And at that point, it's adhoc tags

1566309800
scientes
if they really are numbered then you can access them with typeinfo

1566309806
scientes
cause the compiler numbers them

1566309826
fengb
The numbers aren't always sequential

1566309828
fengb
And they can be missing

1566309830
scientes
oh ok

1566309879
fengb
I'd like a tagging system, but I'm okay without them if I can figure out a decent way around them

1566309893
fengb
I think something like this works:

1566310008
samtebbs
fengb: I haven't followed the conversation but does this help?

1566310027
fengb
I looked at that and got scared

1566310150
scientes
samtebbs, >Zig can't (and probably won't ever) infer return types.

1566310167
scientes
there is a bug for that, and I kinda need it for doing SIMD stuff in user-space instead of the compiler

1566310176
fengb
Yeah I'm not a big fan of inferred return types

1566310195
fengb
At least... not without a working IDE

1566310203
scientes
yeah I get the complaint

1566310215
scientes
but how else am I suppose to concatenate two vectors?

1566310388
scientes
otherwise it ends up as a compiler builtin, and I'm trying to avoid those as much as possible

1566310539
mq32
scientes, can't you just query vector size?

1566310552
mq32
so two-step return type inferring?

1566310574
scientes
that would be really ugly

1566310575
mq32
fn(a : var, b : var) inferReturnTypeForTwoVecs(a,b) { }

1566310592
scientes
but yeah that would work

1566310632
scientes
the actual concatenation is done with @shuffle

1566310683
scientes
there is also a patch in that series where you can do arr[idxs] = vector

1566310688
scientes
where idxs is a vector of indexes

1566310694
scientes
which i thought was pretty slick

1566310708
scientes
but only when arr is a vector right now and idxs is constant

1566310715
scientes
i'm working on doing it with arrays

1566310740
scientes
multiple concurrent assignment

1566310750
scientes
and load

1566310806
mq32
scientes: as you're working on vectors: is swizzling possible (maybe even @shuffle is swizzling)?

1566310832
scientes
not exactly sure what swizzling is, but i'm pretty sure that is shuffle

1566310863
scientes
@shuffle is very versitile

1566310875
scientes
and I made the zig version even more versitile

1566310888
scientes
as the vector sizes don't have to match

1566310913
mq32
swizzling is the shader coding term for

1566310921
mq32
"vec.xyz = vec.wzz"

1566310930
mq32
so indexing a vector with kinda arbitrary indizes

1566310944
scientes
if the index is variable then @shuffle can't do that

1566310957
scientes
and such instructions are only really available on x86 AFAIU

1566311128
mq32
GPUs do it even in assembler

1566311166
scientes
I'm pretty sure swizzling is supported

1566311175
mq32
so you can just expand a float to a vec4 by using "f.xxxx"

1566311188
scientes
one float?

1566311201
scientes
that would be @splat()

1566311211
scientes
(which is implemented in llvm with @shuffle)

1566311217
mq32
hmm

1566311226
scientes
but ppc for example has a special instruction for that

1566311231
scientes
*special instructions

1566311235
mq32
do you plan to index .x, .y and such for vector types?

1566311251
scientes
there was a guy doing that type of stuff with what is already there

1566311291
mq32
the documentation on what is there for vectors is a bit sparse ^^

1566311310
scientes
mq32, are you working from my patch series?

1566311314
scientes
cause I did add documentation

1566311316
mq32
ah

1566311317
scientes
not any examples

1566311321
mq32
then i have to look that up!

1566311335
mq32
do you have a link?

1566311360
scientes


1566320849
andrewrk
daurnimator, --strip prevents debug info from being generated, as well as setting a comptime global constant, which the std lib notices and avoids trying to dump a stack trace when it knows there's no debug info

1566320870
andrewrk
there's one little issue left, where

1566320950
andrewrk
oh I don't think marler knows that you can pass any C cli args between --c-source and the next positional argument

1566323569
Tetralux
Is std.Buffer.appendByte meant to panic if .len == 0?

1566324131
Tetralux
Only I was under the impression that it was just a zero-terminated array.

1566325155
marler899776
andrew just saw your message about --c-source...

1566325192
marler899776
I'm not sure I understand though, how would I pass say "-E"?

1566325215
marler899776
oh wait, you're saying until you see an argument without a "-" in front of it

1566325222
marler899776
got it

1566325322
Tetralux
Should you be able to do this: `var x: EnumType = if (cond) .A else .B;`

1566325330
Tetralux
Only I feel like I should, since I gave it the type.

1566325348
Tetralux
And if you shouldn't be able to, why not?

1566325395
fengb
Peer type inference overwrites result type inference right now

1566325409
fengb
So yes you should be able to but no it’s not working right now

1566325416
FireFox317
This PR solves that:

1566325430
fengb
Oh it’s a PR already?

1566325505
FireFox317
Yes, but i'm not sure if my implementation is correct, it does pass the tests tho

1566325519
fengb
I think this is a different issue:

1566325624
plumm
quick question, any reason why @typeName(@typeOf(A.B.c)) (where A is a struct and B is a nested struct, with c being a boolean property of B)

1566325629
plumm
does not compile?

1566325677
andrewrk
B.c is not valid, there is no instance of B to access c from

1566325692
andrewrk
there is a way to do what you're trying to do however

1566325751
andrewrk
marler899776, it's not perfect because if any C cli args take a positional argument then it'll get messed up. we'll need to adjust that CLI at some point to handle this

1566325765
marler899776
yeah

1566325797
marler899776
--c-args-start ... --c-args-end ?

it's hard to read that output, might be time for a pastebin-like service

marler899776
ok thanks, I'll try to remember to use pastebin in the future as well

1566326598
marler899776
cool, now I'm able to pass -E to "zig cc", but of course not it fails because zig is expecting the output file to be an object file

1566326682
marler899776
there's a couple ways I can think of to get this "Zig C Compiler Emulation" tool to work, I'm wondering which route we should go

1566326731
marler899776
The best idea I have so far is to be able to run "zig cc", but then have a way to signal it to add any applicable libc arguments as well

1566326751
marler899776
Or if there was some way to query the zig compiler for what those libc arguments might be?

1566326794
marler899776
That way we could expose any clang functionality without also having to have an equivalent in zig

andrewrk: I see you merged my PR and added a way to specify the target for the compiler error tests, but since it generates a compiler error on every target and no assembly, does it make sense to specify a target?

1566327546
andrewrk
FireFox317, I actually thought it would be an error if the assembly mismatched the target, but I see now that the other error is checked first. so either way would be fine in this case. but the idea is to isolate only the one error, for each compile error test, so I do think this is better

1566328024
FireFox317
Uhm yes, but for the test that I added it is not a target specific compiler error, so the target shouldn't be specified right? And right now we get an LVVM error when the assembly is not valid on a target.

1566328102
FireFox317
The compiler error I added checks if the variable (thing inside %[..]) is actually specified in the inputs or outputs of the inline assembly.

1566328105
andrewrk
it is a target specific test case because it has inline assembly

1566328147
andrewrk
there's no requirement for the compiler to check whether or not the parameter exists before checking that the assembly matches the target

1566328567
Tetralux
Is std.meta.isSlice(type) meant to return false for []const u8?

1566328575
Tetralux
That seems wrong to me.

1566328900
FireFox317
Well, I think that we always first have to check if a variable inside a inline assembly template is not defined, because if it is not then the inline assembly doesn't make any sense. That is how I see it

1566328975
FireFox317
But for now it is fine anyway, it works and for the self hosted compiler it could be better

1566329271
andrewrk
FireFox317, thanks for the patch

1566329600
andrewrk
FireFox317, it's not out of the question for zig to gain more intelligent understanding of assembly; in this case the compiler could participate more in the syntax and awareness of inline assembly semantics

andrewrk: You are welcome!

marler899776
quick question, how do you access the "tag" field of a tagged union?

1566331559
andrewrk
marler899776, implicit cast to the enum tag type

1566331572
marler899776
thanks

Q: What's the best way to deal with a situation where you do a fn call to start something, you get back a token of some sort, and you `defer token.finish()` or whatever.

1566340812
Tetralux__
Problem is, both starting and finishing the thing can fail.

1566340822
Tetralux
So you can't defer it.

1566344387
Tetralux
Yes, BUT, because you're returning it, it'd copy it into the `thing`.

1566344392
fengb
It wouldn't disappear. Previously it creates a copy upon return, and copy it into the result location

1566344404
Tetralux
fengb:

1566344448
donpdonp
ah, the Self{..} in init would be in the init callstack memory, then copied into the spot inthe callstack for the return value.

1566344508
fengb
yep

1566344513
donpdonp
but now its copied into the address of what its being assign to.

1566344542
Tetralux
Indeed.

1566344549
Tetralux
Except "copy" = "write"

1566344552
Tetralux
So there's no copy.

1566344622
donpdonp
well that helps a lot thx.

1566344649

1566344704
donpdonp
i not saying I would write it  but ive toyed with the idea of a zig basics document and came up with a title: "Zig Pointers" get it?

1566344804
donpdonp
to answer my own other question about the "address" of the return value of init, there is no other address other than &thing because the struct is copied into the ram that was created on the stack for thing (being a var thing: OtherThing and not a pointer)

1566344872
donpdonp
it really does work more like a param to init() than thing = init()

1566344978
andrewrk
yes

1566345023
Tetralux
Indeed - though that part about it really working like a param to init; I should note that's

1566345059
Tetralux
Any fn that returns a value will work like that.

1566345063
donpdonp
aaand my problem is fixed now by using allocator.create() \o/ \o/ im getting nice unique structs at OtherThing()@21f6590 OtherThing()@2342100. Otherthing is actually a Mastodon Toot for

1566345103
Tetralux
Curious :3

1566345304
donpdonp


1566345357
donpdonp
that shows the two kinds of inits. if I var thing = allocator.create(OtherThing) and thing = OtherThing.init() could I keep using fn init() Self{ return Self{} } and it would be copied into the heap?

1566345381
Tetralux
YES

1566345394
donpdonp
id argue that that shortcut is actually not a great idea because here I am reassigning it and yet its dependent on the previous value

1566345420
Tetralux
The thing you get back from .create is undefined.

1566345423
andrewrk
donpdonp, for the heap one it should be `const thing_ptr` not `var thing`

1566345423
Tetralux
So you HAVE to set it.

1566345441
donpdonp
oh. interesting.

1566345443
Tetralux
And yes, as andrewrk said, you get a *OtherThing back from create.

1566345450
andrewrk
and then to initialize it you would do thing_ptr.* = init()

1566345457
Tetralux
^^

1566345465
Tetralux
andrewrk: beat me to it :p

1566345465
donpdonp
okay so THATS the pattern Im missing.

1566345471
Tetralux
HUZZAH

1566345483
Tetralux
BY JOVE I THINK THEY HAVE IT.

1566345484
andrewrk
donpdonp, does it make sense why it would be const?

1566345513
donpdonp
well if thing_ptr were only assigned to once, that would keep later code from changing it?

1566345517
andrewrk
correct

1566345534
andrewrk
just one less accident to worry about

1566345578
donpdonp
'The thing you get back from .create is undefined.' thats still puzzling.
