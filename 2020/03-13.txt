daurnimator
andrewrk: it gets a bit tricky for 64 bit time; e.g. we need to redefine our `struct timespec`.... and then we change/edit `extern "c"` definitions to match

1584059731
andrewrk
what `extern "c"` definitions are you referring to?

1584059765
daurnimator
andrewrk: e.g. `pub extern "c" fn nanosleep(rqtp: *const timespec, rmtp: ?*timespec) c_int;` in std/c.zig

1584068337
daurnimator
andrewrk: any particular comment in #265?

1584070356
pixelherodev
How do I migrate from `setTheTarget(.{.Cross=.{}})`?

1584070408
daurnimator
andrewrk: did you see my comment on #4612 ?

1584070413
pixelherodev
Wanted to get back to work on ZigIRRat but build is broken and that hurt motivation :(

1584070563
daurnimator
pixelherodev: `setTarget(.{})`

1584070597
pixelherodev
Doesn't work - targeting `i386-freestanding`

1584070606
pixelherodev
This is for generating test IR to run the AST on

1584070613
pixelherodev
s/AST/AST generator

1584070650
daurnimator
pixelherodev: "doesn't work"?

1584070711
pixelherodev
`setTarget(.{})` <- did you mean that I should move what was in the .Cross struct into there?

1584070812
daurnimator
pixelherodev: yep.

1584070882
pixelherodev
`./build.zig:22:9: error: no member named 'arch' in struct 'std.zig.cross_target.CrossTarget'` (.arch = .i386)

1584070894
daurnimator
pixelherodev: .arch was moved inside of .cpu

1584070926
andrewrk


1584070960
pixelherodev
Well, might as well do this now

1584070960
pixelherodev
Thanks

1584070967
andrewrk
pixelherodev, you probably want standardTargetOptions:

1584070970
daurnimator
oh. .cpu was flattened?

1584070986
andrewrk
this might actually help you because you can now set a default target

1584071029
andrewrk
const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{}); foo.setTarget(target);

1584071054
andrewrk
or you can just hard code a CrossTarget

1584071074
andrewrk
daurnimator, you might be mixing up std.Target and std.zig.CrossTarget

1584071117
pixelherodev
Right but I don't

1584071147
pixelherodev
Generating native binary for test library frontend, i386 test binary, and ... well, it's technically still marked as i386 but the third is a custom ISA I'm testing

1584071156
pixelherodev
It's 32-bit so i386 maps "close enough"

1584071282
pixelherodev
Zig 0.6 will be mid-April, right? I'm thinking I'll stick to 0.6 (and maybe backport bugfixes from trunk on a local branch) when it's released :P

1584071363
andrewrk
so you probably want to use that whitelist feature then

1584071822
pixelherodev
The what?

1584071839
pixelherodev
CPU features whitelist?

1584071934
andrewrk
never mind. what was `setTheTarget(.{.Cross=.{}})` even doing? that doesn't look valid to me. there were no default values for those fields

1584071993
daurnimator
andrewrk: I was recalling a previous change:

1584072050
andrewrk
yes that was still std.Target. now there is a new struct, std.zig.CrossTarget

1584072101
pixelherodev
andrewrk, I had actual values in there but didn't consider them relevant to the question

1584072355
andrewrk
if you give the actual example I can give you the actual code to update it to

1584072427
pixelherodev
Basically just i386-freestanding

1584072463
pixelherodev
{.arch = .i386, .os = .freestanding, .abi = .none, .cpu_features = (zag.Target.Arch.i386).getBaselineCpuFeatures()`

1584072611
andrewrk
setTarget(.{.cpu_arch = .i386, .os_tag = .freestanding, .abi = .none})

1584072620
andrewrk
the cpu features thing is not needed anymore

1584072723
pixelherodev
Yay!

1584072785
pixelherodev
Thanks!

1584072795
pixelherodev
... and now I run into a compiler regression :(

1584072797
pixelherodev
I'll bisect later

1584072812
pixelherodev
`Assertion failed at ../src/buffer.hpp:37 in buf_ptr. This is a bug in the Zig compiler`

1584072843
pixelherodev
The frontend builds, it's only that i386-freestanding LLVM IR that fails...

1584073085
andrewrk
that assertion looks like it might have a straightforward fix

1584073118
andrewrk
I'll be happy to look into this before the release. that goes for anyone btw, if you have a regression and your project isn't building

1584073270
pixelherodev
Going to try trunk again

1584073278
pixelherodev
It's possible I broke it when bisecting a different issue :P

1584073332
pixelherodev
Yep, now I have an entirely

1584073376
pixelherodev
... nope that's still there too

1584073385
pixelherodev
Just had a pleasant surprise with streams :)

1584073401
pixelherodev
(inStream() now gives what was previously inStream().stream?! YAY!)

1584073456
pixelherodev
I'll look into the bug myself real quick

1584073492
daurnimator
andrewrk: we broke every zig hello-world with the change in signature of file.write.

1584073533
pixelherodev
What happened?

1584073536
pixelherodev
I've clearly missed a

1584073585
daurnimator
pixelherodev: write() on posix systems can return with a partial write -> file.write now returns number of bytes written instead of void

1584073669
andrewrk
daurnimator, correct

1584073721
andrewrk
hello world from 0.5.0 -> master already had 1 breaking change. so think of it like buy 1 get 1 free

1584073729
daurnimator
not great for all the misc blog posts out there :(

1584073733
Nilium
Is std.Target only defined in specific cases? Kind of confused at why it's missing from std.zig in the Homebrew package but present in the 0.5.0 docs.

1584073764
andrewrk
Nilium, std.zig never had Target

1584073786
daurnimator
huh?

1584073806
daurnimator
even today in builtin we spit out `/// Deprecated: use `std.Target.cpu.arch`

1584073837
Nilium
I mean, it might not be part of the source, hence why I'm asking

1584073856
Nilium
I couldn't figure out how to use it in build.zig, since it doesn't seem to exist in std

1584073857
daurnimator
Nilium:

1584073874
Nilium
So maybe the homebrew package is borked...

1584073883
andrewrk
not to be confused with

1584073901
Nilium
Yeah - that's a different one than I'm referring to.

1584073908
Nilium
The one I'm referring to is what daurnimator mentioned.

1584073923
daurnimator
Nilium: do you have the 0.5.0 package? or master? (or old master?)

1584073930
Nilium
0.5.0

1584073938
Nilium
Hang on, let me grab the other laptop

1584073977
andrewrk
Nilium, 0.5.0 doesn't have std.Target

1584073989
andrewrk
where do you see it in the docs?

1584074001
Nilium
I'm trying to find the link I followed to get the stdlib docs.

1584074023
Nilium
Yeah, looks like it's the master docs, so that explains it

1584074035
Nilium
OK, so probably just.. always use master.

1584074051
Nilium
Seems like it's hard to follow things otherwise.

1584074057
andrewrk
0.6.0 will be a nice release to stick to, at least for a few months

1584074085
Nilium
I mean, this is normal for pre-1.0 languages, so nothing wrong with it.

1584074146
andrewrk
I'm really not worried about breaking hello world, or anything else, pre-1.0. there is nothing more important than getting the language and std lib correct before stabilizing

1584074161
Nilium
I agree.

1584074175
pixelherodev
andrewrk, found the bug - it only occurs with `--no-emit-bin`

1584074201
pixelherodev
src/main.cpp:1306 calls `buf_ptr(&g->bin_file_output_path)`, which is of course empty because there

1584074256
pixelherodev
Wait no... that's where the crash is happening, but I don't follow the logic looking back

1584074273
pixelherodev
Ah wait never mind - the call I thought ruined that logic chain only occurs on Windows

1584074396
daurnimator
I generally have found that I can stick on a zig release for ~2.5 months before it gets too out of sync with master

1584076348
Nilium
Yeah. It’s not a problem with anything other than me having mismatched information.

1584115978
fengb
Whoa no feedback, just merge? >_>

1584116677
andrewrk
what kind of feedback were you expecting?

1584116690
fengb
"Hey you suck"

1584116724
fengb
I don't know. I just dont expect my first round to be okay :P

1584117489
andrewrk
I did sneak a "fixup" commit in there if you didn't see it

1584117517
fengb
How will I learn if you fix stuff for me? >_>

1584117634
andrewrk
I don't really see it that way. sometimes it's harder for contributors to make certain kinds of changes, e.g. breaking changes, and it has nothing to do with learning/skill and more to do with the structure of decision making

1584117754
fengb
Ah I see

1584117772
fengb
Basically all my questions were answered heh. Okay thanks

1584117798
andrewrk
thanks for the patch :)

1584117831
fengb
Thanks for letting me experiment like this :)

1584118665
jessermeyer
I need to explicitly pass 'self' parameters when using std functions, right? e.g fn openFile(self: Dir, sub_path: []const u8, flags: OpenFlags)... I can't just do std.fs.Dir.openFile("/path/to/file.txt");

1584118810
andrewrk
you could do std.fs.cwd().openFile("/path/to/file.txt")

1584118834
andrewrk
but if you have an absolute directory then you can use std.fs.openFileAbsolute

1584118844
jessermeyer
Yeeeaah was just about to suggest that to myself, after looking up examples in the standard library.

1584118848
jessermeyer
Right.

1584118881
TheLemonMan
ooh, Travis offers a ppc64le CI for open-source projects

1584118952
euantor
I believe sr.ht is going to offer ppc64le at some point too - there was talk in the channel about them having a system from Raptor CS that was going to become a build slave eventually

1584120148
TheLemonMan
Raptor systems are quite cool as they are pricey

1584120249
pixelherodev
Is it possible to send patches to the Zig mailing list on SourceHut instead of opening GitHub PRs? I'm moving as far away from GitHub as I can given their, uh, "brilliant" decision to make the notifications API worse

1584120254
pixelherodev
s/API/UI

1584120292
andrewrk
yes you can send patches however you like

1584120344
andrewrk
but as usual, the easier you make the patch to merge, the more likely it gets merged sooner

1584120374
pixelherodev
Right, that's reasonable

1584120389
TheLemonMan
uh? what's up with the GH notifications?

1584120398
pixelherodev
They're torturing the UI

1584120408
pixelherodev


1584120516
TheLemonMan


1584120523
andrewrk
same

1584120595
pixelherodev
There are too many Zig notifications alone to go through them by email for me

1584120630
TheLemonMan
andrewrk, golang solves the "lightweight-loop" problem by double-locking a mutex, that's really smart

1584120662
andrewrk
thanks, despite seeming simple that took me a good 15 minutes of chin-scratching to come up with

1584120723
andrewrk
#4731 is a really nice improvement. it's going to be quite handy when debugging multi threaded event loops

1584120729
TheLemonMan
but the stdlib mutex don't have a blocking acquire :(

1584120749
TheLemonMan
yeah I wrote that as I was playing around with the event loop on FreeBSD

1584120759
andrewrk
why do you think it doesn't?

1584120813
TheLemonMan
eh because I'm dumb and was reading the single_threaded implementation of Mutex

1584120923
andrewrk
yeah the single-threaded use case is why to check if the atomicrmw is 0 above, rather than simply double-acquire

1584121018
andrewrk
pixelherodev, I really don't understand that criticism, can't he just resize his browser window to be smaller

1584121042
andrewrk
just checked... it works fine

1584121254
pixelherodev
Not if you're using a tiled window manager (which I do as well)

1584121268
pixelherodev
I had the same problem

1584121281
pixelherodev
(for the brief minutes where I tested it)

1584121325
TheLemonMan
andrewrk, I've pushed a slightly different approach

1584121339
pixelherodev
And I think the "it blends notifications from multiple repos together" part was more of a concern anyways

1584121342
TheLemonMan
no global mutex, I create one in the loop scope and deadlock there

1584121367
TheLemonMan
in single-thread mode that path is never taken as the panicked goes back to 0

1584121382
pixelherodev
`The title of the notification no longer stands out, as it’s the same size as the name of the repo that was affected. They’re no longer grouped by repo, either, so I have to read both every time to get the full context.`

1584121385
pixelherodev
^

1584121450
TheLemonMan
you can probably write your own notification display with a few lines of code

1584121486
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, this is definitely an improvement over status quo and I'd be happy to merge as is, but do you think it might make sense to make deadlocking a mutex Illegal Behavior? this way if we ever wanted to improve debug mode mutexes we could add some (optional?) debugging features to them

1584121495
andrewrk
we already do this for --single-threaded

1584121559
andrewrk
this adds a dependency on defining the behavior of double-locking a mutex with the same thread to be a deadlock, rather than Don't Do This, And Tools Will Help You Debug It If You Do

1584121766
TheLemonMan


1584121769
andrewrk
the beauty of the approach I outlined is that it doesn't depend on same-thread deadlocking - it only relies on "normal" mutex behavior of thread(s) waiting on other(s)

1584121812
TheLemonMan
the idle loop could be replaced with an evel simpler `while (true) sleep(a_lot);` if we don't want to stray into the IB realm

1584121822
pixelherodev
To clarify my message from this morning: `src/main.cpp:1306 calls `buf_ptr(&g->bin_file_output_path)`, which is of course empty because there

1584121835
pixelherodev
My thought that it was

1584121880
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, but this is a default panic handler and sleep() has a more difficult OS dependency than Mutex

1584121894
TheLemonMan
same-thread deadlocking means we also have to store the thread id somewhere... that may bloat the parking-lot mutex

1584121908
andrewrk
as an example, --single-threaded Mutex has no OS dependency, but sleep() still would

1584121954
TheLemonMan
hm, gotcha

1584122008
TheLemonMan
we also have some kind of OS (or better, ABI) dependency since `threadlocal` is used

1584122046
TheLemonMan
I don't really expect bare-metal/OS-less people to use the default handler

1584122052
pixelherodev
What does `--single-threaded` actually *do*?

1584122065
andrewrk


1584122074
pixelherodev
Ah, it's in the docs :) Thanks!

1584122217
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, based on my understanding, OS's that have multi-threading generally support thread local variables, and ones that don't we make --single-threaded the default (and therefore thread local variables become simply globals)

1584122297
andrewrk
oh, I see the flaw in my approach

1584122342
andrewrk
the first one to increment panicking is not necessarily the correct one to call abort()

1584122423
TheLemonMan
yeah, `panicking` is a rough count of how many waiting threads there are

1584122460
TheLemonMan
I spent a lot of time tracking down a bug in a previous implementation because I was sure @atomicRmw returned the new value

1584122682
andrewrk
ok I think your latest iteration is good to merge

1584122724
andrewrk
I think my approach was fine, but it does possibly result in the same thread locking the same mutex and expecting a deadlock. so it's not better than the simpler approach you have

1584122836
TheLemonMan
hmm, what if we just use a `ResetEvent` ?

1584122963
andrewrk
that sounds right

1584123004
TheLemonMan
thank you kprotty

1584123009
andrewrk
indeed

1584123278
TheLemonMan
enforcing the mutex lock/unlock thread to be the same is an interesting idea tho

1584123380
andrewrk
yeah. I think the language and std lib should help debug multi-threaded software

1584123402
andrewrk
we don't have the nice multi-threaded guarantees like rust, so the least we can do is provide helpful debugging tools

1584126083
FireFox317
how do i get llvm10? can i just clone llvm-project and checkout `release/10.x`?

1584126156
FireFox317
or is there an easier way?

1584126180
andrewrk
FireFox317, release/10.x branch is your best bet right now since it's not released yet

1584126222
FireFox317
andrewrk, thanks!

1584126489
pixelherodev
Testing a fix for that issue I was having

1584126504
FireFox317
its not possible to build llvm with cmake anymore :(

1584126537
andrewrk
it worked for me

1584126539
FireFox317
nvm

1584126542
FireFox317
wrong dir lol

1584126583
andrewrk
oh nice, they just cut rc4

1584126595
andrewrk
like, minutes ago

1584126764
FireFox317
rc4 is probably gonna be the one thats gonna be released right?

1584126910
andrewrk
likely

1584126920
andrewrk
i'm merging master into llvm10 for you

1584126959
FireFox317
ah cool, im working on some riscv stuff and i hope llvm10 is gonna solve some things that arent working now

1584127109
TheLemonMan
riscv stuff? spill the beans!

1584127250
FireFox317
risc-v operating system, starting simple with something like xv6, but finally i want it to work on my own fpga :)

1584127398
TheLemonMan
cool! syntesized CPUs are awesome

1584127561
pixelherodev
Okay, fixed the problem with building for i386, but now my build.zig is crashing ``/usr/local/lib/zig/std/build.zig:2157:63` "attempted to use null value" :(

1584127613
BaroqueLarouche
do I need to compile LLVM 10 right now if you merge the llvm10 into master ?

1584127629
TheLemonMan
master into llvm10

1584127637
TheLemonMan
not the other way around

1584127643
BaroqueLarouche
oh

1584127665
BaroqueLarouche
read too fast

1584127669
andrewrk
llvm10 branch has master merged in, I just did it

1584127734
andrewrk
we merge llvm10 into master as soon as llvm 10 is officially released

1584128331
andrewrk
at that point building llvm/clang/lld from source could be the easiest way to obtain a source build, but you can also expect ziglang.org/downloads to work

1584128348
andrewrk
and that is because I manually go and build llvm from source for all the ci machines

1584128369
TheLemonMan
oh I was about to ask if you compiled llvm9 on freebsd yourself

1584128415
TheLemonMan
NetBSD wins, it compiled just fine with llvm/clang installed from ports

1584128437
andrewrk
thanks pixelherodev

1584128443
pixelherodev
Yeah no problem

1584128447
pixelherodev
Thought it would be an easy fix like that

1584128453
pixelherodev
Now to figure out the next failure :(

1584128497
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, yeah I just pay a couple bucks for a high performance server for 2 hours

1584128526
andrewrk
just to upload that tarball for the CI

1584128612
andrewrk
pixelherodev, it's related to the other change... the build system is expecting the compiler to print the path to the build artifact

1584128637
pixelherodev
But - that doesn't make sense anymore

1584128646
pixelherodev
Given that there can be (deliberately) multiple artifacts

1584128657
pixelherodev
e.g. binary, LLVM IR, and assembly

1584128665
andrewrk
yeah it should just print the output dir not a specific build artifact

1584128671
pixelherodev
Ah

1584128686
andrewrk
that's all the build system wants anyway

1584128752
pixelherodev
Will take a bit for me to find where that happens

1584128807
pixelherodev
Ahh, I get it. It's the same change I just made

1584128864
pixelherodev
Wait

1584128871
pixelherodev
Why is there a different path for the different output types?

1584128879
pixelherodev
Shouldn't they all be output to the same folder?

1584129060
pixelherodev
Think I got it

1584129068
pixelherodev
Well, not an understanding of that

1584129069
pixelherodev
But a fix

1584129075
pixelherodev
for the build.zig failure

1584129501
pixelherodev
Got it working, but it's working around the fact there are multiple paths instead of consolidating them, which it really should IMO

1584130466
FireFox317
hmm andrewrk, i'm getting build errors when building zig with llvm10. has to do with lld, i guess its because now its using my system lld?
