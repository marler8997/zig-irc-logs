1578873600
Snektron
I suppose theres nothing wrong with that strategy on a technical level, but it was a bit unintuitive

1578873603
companion_cube
so you just allocate AST nodes by bumping an offset?

1578873756
andrewrk
yes

1578873759
andrewrk
roughly

1578873810
andrewrk
std.heap.ArenaAllocator does have a linked list mechanism if it runs out

1578873830
companion_cube
you can just use a list of arenas, right?

1578873856
mikdusan
the arena

1578873867
companion_cube
a list of chunks, pfff

1578874866
hryx
andrewrk: This comment got me wondering. Does the grammar belong in the documentation, or should it only live in the language spec?

1578874885
hryx
and then the docs link to the spec and grammar

1578874944
companion_cube
if you make a spec, someone will come and implement it and we'll have two implemtations 🙃

1578874997
hryx
the more the merrier

1578875104
fengb
You can make it impossibly complicated like OOXML :P

1578875211
andrewrk
hryx, the spec is the canonical location; it's copied to the lang ref for convenience of people reading it

1578875301
rankao
Question, is there a way to coerce a optional into a non-optional?

1578875332
pixelherodev
`.?`

1578875346
pixelherodev
e.g. if you have an optional called `a`, `a.?` gives you the non-optional form

1578875357
pixelherodev
It also asserts that a isn't null, causing a runtime error if it is

1578875359
hryx
andrewrk: do you think it would be redundant once the spec is written and hosted on the zig website? Doesn't bother me either way, I just noticed it's prone to getting out of sync as seen in that commit comment

1578875410
rankao
It didn't click with me that `assert(x.? == 1234);` was coercing it into a non-optional

1578875427
hryx
rankao: in this case it's typically called "unwrapping" rather than coercing

1578875443
rankao
Yeah. It's what I'm used to from Rust.

1578875446
andrewrk
hryx, eventually we could make docgen pull it from a canonical location. I also think this problem will solve itself once the language stabilizes

1578875480
hryx
yeah, good point

1578875703
rankao


1578876485
daurnimator
andrewrk: I just sat down with kees cook and went over some paths to getting zig into the linux kernel

1578876722
andrewrk
daurnimator, nice! ask him if we can plz have

1578876760
andrewrk
to make temp files with no path, and then "materialize" them into the file system atomically

1578876845
daurnimator
I thought you could already do that with memfd

1578876860
andrewrk
don't think so

1578876867
daurnimator
or maybe I'm thinking of something else

1578876971
pixelherodev
That - sounds really really useful

1578876975
mikdusan
sounds like the inverse of unlink (refcount goes to 0) and file node exists only in memory ?

1578877064
daurnimator
Can you link from /proc/self/fd/ ?

1578877068
andrewrk
the important part about the patch is the part where it goes from being in memory only, atomically to the file system

1578877446
pixelherodev
How's that different from `mv /tmp/file /somewherereal/file`?

1578877491
andrewrk
renaming into place requires /tmp/file to exist

1578877532
andrewrk
if the application loses power between creating /tmp/file and the rename() then there will be garbage /tmp/file

1578877842
daurnimator
andrewrk: can you link from /proc/self/fd to the file system?

1578877877
pixelherodev
No there won't; tmpfs exists only in memory

1578877895
pixelherodev
If the device loses power, tmpfs gets cleared

1578877907
fengb
Most people have /tmp mapped into the HDD

1578877916
mikdusan
I'm looking at link() and linkat() manpage. I don't see how it can work without 2 paths; so what is path1 supposed to be if you only have fd1?

1578877944
daurnimator
pixelherodev: huh?

1578877999
daurnimator
pixelherodev: you can call open() with O_TMPFILE and then linkat it into place via /proc

1578878024
andrewrk
mikdusan, you can have an fd that does not correspond to a path. but without AT_REPLACE for linkat (the flag introduced in the patch), there is no way to atomically make the fd gain a path on the file system

1578878034
daurnimator
andrewrk: yes you can.....

1578878046
andrewrk
prove it

1578878062
daurnimator
andrewrk: there's even an example in the manpage open(2)

1578878140
daurnimator


1578878156
andrewrk
daurnimator, what syscall do you perform once you've written the data to the tmp file fd, in order to give it a path in the file system?

1578878169
daurnimator
andrewrk: linkat

1578878212
andrewrk
it will give EEXIST if the destination file exists

1578878236
andrewrk
this patch adds AT_REPLACE so that linkat can replace the target

1578878251
daurnimator
ah right

1578878296
daurnimator
fengb: most people do

1578878343
daurnimator
but in any case, for linkat to work you need to be on the correct file system/partition

1578878365
pixelherodev
`Most people have /tmp mapped into the HDD` Wait really?

1578878368
pixelherodev
Weird

1578878405
andrewrk
(1) open directory fd which contains the destination file to overwrite. (2) O_TMPFILE to get an fd to write replacement file to. write replacement data. (3) linkat(AT_REPLACE) to atomically overwrite destination

1578878443
andrewrk
this guarantees no trash left around after application crash or power loss, and atomic replacement of dest file

1578878552
daurnimator
I'm in a RISCV session at the moment. Anything in particular we want to know?

1578878565
mikdusan
path1 is the

1578878582
daurnimator
mikdusan: it's meant to be the one in proc.

1578878588
daurnimator
mikdusan: see the man page (which I pasted above)

1578878601
andrewrk
daurnimator, I think we're good on risc-v front. I'd be interested if there were any CI service

1578878615
daurnimator
andrewrk: they say use qemu

1578878626
andrewrk
yeah we do already, cool

1578878667
mikdusan
daurnimator: ah ok. so /proc

1578878719
mikdusan
they need a linkat2()

1578878821
daurnimator
mikdusan: I think you can do that via AT_EMPTY_PATH today? though it requires CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH

1578879070
daurnimator
mikdusan:

1578879083
fengb
Apparently I need to get current with my Linux knowledge. Back in my day, we mapped /tmp manually to ram and we liked it 🦖

1578879280
mikdusan
solaris used to do that

1578879325
mikdusan
actually it was (still is?) swap-backed

1578881306
daurnimator
so I'm working from lemonboy's patch earlier

1578881337
daurnimator
of course I ended up hitting "extern structs cannot contain fields of type 'u1'"

1578881350
daurnimator
andrewrk: ^

1578882565
daurnimator
I removed that error path in the hope things would "just work"

1578882572
daurnimator
Managed to get this failure: mem.zig:286:40: error: out of bounds pointer access

1578882629
daurnimator
(which is in mem.zeroes)

1578888998
daurnimator
`@sizeOf(struct { x: u32 align(4096) })` == 4096

1578889024
daurnimator
is it legal to cast that to a [4096]u8 ?

1578894466
terinjokes
i wrote some awful code today. :(

1578894533
rankao
That is what refactoring is for

1578894577
terinjokes
true. currently debating on if i want to commit, or wait until tomorrow night to do some refactoring and then do so

1578894678
rankao
If the code works. Commit then refactor.

1578894690
rankao
Especially if you got tests

1578894777
terinjokes
yeah, that's next...

1578894793
terinjokes
and then seeing how difficult it is to hook zig code up to afl

1578894884
rankao
I'm not very good with initialisms out of context. What is afl?

1578894944
terinjokes
american fuzzy lop, a security fuzzer

1578895263
terinjokes
i forgot libFuzz is in llvm, so maybe easier than I initially thought

1578897536
andrewrk
daurnimator, `packed` not `extern` for bit fields

1578899789
D3zmodos
Are there any plans to support function overloading? If not, what's the justification? I understand the lack of operator overloading because it hides code but surely that alone doesn't quite cover function overloading (since different overloads are identifiable at the call site)?

1578899990
hryx
D3zmodos: a GitHub issue search reveals several rejected proposals related to function overloading

1578900259
D3zmodos
hryx:  Ah, I checked the docs but didn't think to check github. Thanks!

1578900322
hryx
D3zmodos: no problem! The github issue tracker has an absolute wealth of history regarding language changes

1578913687
daurnimator
andrewrk: that's the issue I was on before: if you have a C struct it can have bitfields

1578913707
daurnimator
andrewrk: if you want to translate it to a packed struct then you need to know details of the target (including width of things)

1578913815
daurnimator
If `extern struct` supported bitfields then it can be done at zig compile-time (vs at translate-c time)

1578919665
betawaffle
is there somewhere i should be looking at for differences between current master and 0.5.0, besides the git diff?

1578919681
betawaffle
something like in-progress release notes

1578919723
betawaffle
as an example, it seems like @typeOf is now @TypeOf?

1578920093
betawaffle
also totally unrelated question: is it safe to await a frame in two threads simultaneously?

1578920612
scientes
betawaffle, i don't think so

1578920685
betawaffle
is there some code i can read to see what await actually does under the hood?

1578922733
fengb
Async functions can only be awaited once

1578922789
betawaffle
what's the interaction between await and resume/suspend?

1578923006
fengb
Resume/suspend is a lot more low level. You need those to build primitives, like IO, but you consume existing async functions with await

1578924125
fengb
I believe await is equivalent to “suspend until the async function is complete and then get that return value”

1578924366
betawaffle
is there a difference between [*]const u8 and [*:0]const u8 ? are they both pointers to null-terminated arrays?

1578924413
fengb
Only the latter is null termination

1578924437
fengb
The former might be but that’s only if you converted an existing null terminated array so it’s unreliable

1578924480
betawaffle
so, how does one safely call this: pub fn openat(dirfd: i32, path: [*]const u8, flags: u32, mode: usize) usize

1578924506
fengb
Hmm that signature might be old and forgot to annotate null terminated

1578924520
betawaffle
it has a todo to that effect, yeah

1578924534
fengb
It was recently introduced and we may have missed some sites

1578924562
betawaffle
grep the codebase for `

1578924637
betawaffle
ok so the idea in that case is... it used to be "caller is expected to do the right thing" and the new way can help enforce that?

1578924728
fengb
Yep

1578924772
fengb
Passing in a null terminated string will auto coerce into the non-terminated pointer so it’s a typecheck issue but you can still use it

1578924815
betawaffle
but it's not like you get any of that safety in C, anyway

1578924857
fengb
Well we only set C as a bare minimum baseline. We can be better :P

1578924894
betawaffle
so far i'm loving zig. just wish it had fewer compiler crashes

1578924973
fengb
Yeah it’s been pretty unstable. Unfortunately that won’t be a very high priority until stage 2

1578924994
betawaffle
what's holding up stage2?

1578925011
betawaffle
or i guess, what's higher priority than stage2?

1578925075
fengb
Lots of language changes. Old async was blocking a lot of functionality, and andrewrk didn’t want to work on it without more language stability

1578925120
betawaffle
is there a tracking issue or something for what's blocking stage2?

1578925126
betawaffle
*still blocking

1578925784
fengb
I don’t think anything is directly blocking anymore

1578925845
fengb
Based on a recent stream, the priority is: fix some result location bugs, async OutStream, then package manager or stage 2

1578926147
mikdusan
betawaffle:

1578926160
betawaffle
ah sweet, thanks mikdusan

1578926427
fengb
Oh wow did you start this page?

1578926465
mikdusan
aye

1578926519
mikdusan
it's a bit of a PITA for linking to commits because wiki is in a diff repo. unless i'm doing something wrong.

1578926570
fengb
I thought about it generating something from closed breaking issues

1578926637
mikdusan
I don't think it will be too much work to maintain. It doesn't have to be the quality of release notes, just good pointers.

1578926737
fengb
Yeah but I'm also lazy :P

1578926760
fengb
I'd spend days automating something because I don't want to do 5 minutes of manual work >_>

1578927019
betawaffle
how do threadlocal variables work on a freestanding target? (or do they not work?)

1578927173
mq32
betawaffle: threadlocal isn't a concept that exists on freestanding

1578927187
betawaffle
so it'd be a compiler error then?

1578927190
mq32
as freestanding has no real concept of multithreading at all (you don't have an OS)

1578927197
mq32
i think they will jsut be a normal variable

1578927205
betawaffle
ah, ok

1578927255
mikdusan


1578927290
betawaffle
i'd be interested to see someone write a zig kernel that supports SMP

1578927350
fengb
Are you volunteering? 🙃

1578927370
betawaffle
i want to learn how to do that, so yeah

1578927401
betawaffle
i have a job, so it'll be slow-going, of course

1578927670
fengb
Is there a way to rm -rf the cmake build directory while also preserving original flags?

1578927980
mikdusan
you mean remove adir recursively

1578928113
fengb
I want to do something like `make distclean`. cmake recommends deleting the build folder, but I have some flags that I always want to use

1578931803
SyrupThinker
> i'd be interested to see someone write a zig kernel that supports SMP

1578931803
SyrupThinker
On it (: I won't promise anything though ;D

1578935868
Snektron
fengb, arent the flags stored in CMakeCache.txt?

1578935887
Snektron
If so, you could probably delete everything but that

1578935888
Snektron
maybe

1578935892
Snektron
dont quote me on that

1578935999
Snektron
Why do you want to remove the cmake build dir if i may ask? Shouldn't that update itself automatically?

1578936039
fengb
Sometimes the cache is wrong, and there's no `make distclean` equivalent

1578936066
fengb
The recommended approach is to delete the build folder entirely, but that means I gotta lookup those flags

1578936376
andrewrk
fengb, my solution to this is a long shell history file and ctrl+r search for cmake

1578936440
andrewrk
I don't think cmake has a better answer to this question. you can remove the CMakeCache.txt file but I've run into times when removing the entire dir was necessary

1578936523
rankao
So Andrew I watched your talk about how Zig came to be, and I've notice a bit more features like async tooling and such as `suspend` and `resume` added to the language. Why was that added into the language versus STDLib? Do you have a blog or a write up you talked about that?

1578936564
rankao
I've also watched a few of your youtube videos on async stuff, but I haven't finish them all. So if that question is answered there I'll get to that eventually

1578936622
andrewrk


1578936793
rankao
Thanks

1578937025
mikdusan
fengb: are the flags you want to preserve well defined enough to put into a sep file?

1578937035
fengb
andrewrk: any chance we can make "ZIG_SKIP_INSTALL_LIB_FILES" the default? 😇

1578937059
rankao
Okay. After reading that I'm going to re-watch your Async youtube coding sessions. Though I'm kind of glad I watched them first since I think this makes it make more sense.

1578937087
fengb
Yeah, it's just been bugging more now that I have 2 flags (ZIG_SKIP_INSTALL_LIB_FILES and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH)

1578937101
mikdusan
so I just tried this and seems to work:

1578937118
mikdusan
create a foo.script file, put in things like:

1578937124
mikdusan
set(ZIG_SKIP_INSTALL_LIB_FILES on CACHE BOOL "")

1578937131
mikdusan
set(ZIG_ENABLE_MEM_PROFILE off CACHE BOOL "")

1578937137
rankao
And after reading the single threaded mode code it makes sense why just have it part of the language. Because if I compile it for a micro controller each async function call will simply be blocking instead of whatever it was before.

1578937164
mikdusan
then launch cmake with all usual args

1578937276
andrewrk
fengb, I think there's a good case to be made to do that. It will mean requiring non-default settings for package maintainers, but they're used to that.

1578937298
andrewrk
I'm annoyed at cmake because if they just allowed running a custom command on the install target, we wouldn't need a config setting at all

1578937350
fengb
Oh I didn't realize it'd interfere with packaging. I was just confused that I always had a duplicated library that desyncs

1578937405
andrewrk
if you think about it, making a duplicated library that desyncs is exactly what "installation" is

1578937429
fengb
But I didn't ask for installation heh

1578937452
andrewrk
yeah I agree your default choice makes more sense

1578937463
fengb
I'm not sure why I added 'heh' there. That sounds weird

1578937505
andrewrk
rankao, that's nearly correct. single threaded mode is related to async functions only in that `await` and `return` longer use atomic operations for synchronizing

1578937557
andrewrk
the setting that controls whether various parts of the standard library are blocking or evented is a userland concept: std.io.mode

1578937570
rankao
I see.

1578937572
andrewrk
it can be specified in the root source file

1578937619
andrewrk
btw fengb I'm working on finishing

1578937728
fengb
Great!

1578938019
gonz_
Does anyone have a solution for the watch windows on Windows not being able to actually bind to the actual values? They show up in "locals" but it seems impossible to do anything within the watch window.

1578938031
BaroqueLarouche
gonz_: VS Code ?

1578938072
Snektron
fengb  the zig build root is not in ny path at all, so also installing lib files seems like the appropriate way?

1578938074
gonz_
VS Code, VS, anywhere really.

1578938091
gonz_
I haven't checked WinDbg lately but I assume it's the same.

1578938118
gonz_
I seem to remember this working at some point, but I'm also curious what other peoples' experience is.

1578938150
fengb
Snektron: I wired my build zig to my path, and it works with and without the lib copy. But with the lib copy, I need to run make every time I make a change to std

1578938154
gonz_
Since we interact fine with locals, it seems super weird that we can't bind even to the same values in the watch window...

1578938243
fengb
daurnimator pointed out that there's a flag to prevent the lib copy, which works really well but it's an extra step to remember

1578938275
BaroqueLarouche
gonz: I was able to use the watch window in some case in VS Code, but it doesn't always work

1578938417
fengb
I'm actually impressed at how the zig executable works well no matter which path it's in

1578938517
gonz_
BaroqueLarouche: It's unfortunate; there doesn't seem to be much reason for zig to be such a "meh" debugging experience atm.

1578938536
andrewrk
gonz_, does it work with C code from a clang binary?

1578938571
gonz_
andrewrk: Haven't checked, but I'll make sure to

1578939046
Snektron
When i work on zig i usually run `ninja` instead of `ninja install`

1578939055
Snektron
afaik that stops copying

1578939093
Snektron
or did you mean to the build directory? because i'm not sure about that

1578939103
Snektron
but i don't notice any problems with it

1578940010
gonz_
andrewrk: Is there any logic that might point to private functions not having the same debugging info as public ones?

1578940036
gonz_
Actually, nevermind; it's not that.

1578941865
fengb
Snektron: yeah, by default make (and I'd guess ninja) copies lib/ into build/ so if I'm actively working on lib then it desyncs until I run make again

1578941972
mikdusan
fengb: thoughts?

1578942803
nocko`
I finished writing the in-place uboot upgrading application for embedded linux I talked about last week.

1578942821
nocko`
It's "baby's first zig", but it functions well:

1578942875
nocko`
Any suggestions / comments highly appreciated.

1578943002
nocko`
There's a few janky parts. I link libc basically just for a default allocator. I could just hard code a FixedBufferAllocator for this particular case... but that's weird too.

1578943043
nocko`
Anyway. It's being used on mipsel. Tier-2; no arch issues came up during development. So, that's cool.

1578943085
nocko`
I think that's a pretty new thing (being tier-2). IDK how many users is has, but totally painless.

1578943569
scientes
cool

1578944258

question time: i'm new to non-GC / manual mem-mgmt. how can i best intuit when to `deinit()` something and when not to. especially when I don't know what Allocator is passed to my lib. consider this example:

1578944258
metaleap
cause any faults. the last one ln7 (commented-out) would segfault however. but here that `deinit` is just "inherited" from `array_list.AlignedArrayList` that `std.json.Array` aliases. having read lifetime-and-ownership section in zig's langref doc, I'm none the wiser. how would seasoned C (and/or Zig) devs illuminate the generally applicable path-of-reasoning here for otherwise-experienced devs coming from some GC stack like Go / C# / Java etc?

1578944374
metaleap
note the segfault occurs exactly on the ln#7 deinit call, which from defer would be scheduled before the (potentially otherwise conflicting) others, and there would be no accesses-to-this-arraylist occurring afterwards anyway, tho it doesnt get to "afterwards"

1578944677
fengb
You should deinit any resource that you used but aren’t exposing

1578944694
nocko``
Not my area of expertise. Initial thought is that a slice always refers to a backing array... You're returning a reference to a slice from rootarr, but the memory for rootarr is destroyed at the end of the function.

1578944710
fengb
The last line indicates you are returning the memory so it’s up to the caller to own that space

1578944809
betawaffle
metaleap: have you run it in a debugger yet?

1578944874
betawaffle
i think we need to see what `as` does in this case, if the segfault is really coming from rootarr.deinit()

1578944903
betawaffle
that would indicate something about rootarr is invalid from the start

1578944913
metaleap
fengb: no it doesnt, the call in the last line gets the Allocator but returns either error or some own created slice

1578944953
metaleap
nocko``: i'm not returning a slice from rootarr, i'm passing it to a call whose return is returned

1578944961
fengb
oh right, the mem variable name threw me off

1578944972
metaleap
defer would (or should!) only occur after that final call

1578945013
nocko``
hmm. Interesting.

1578945067
metaleap
betawaffle: added the (tiny & trivial) `as` to the gist, doesn't really "do" anything other than tag/type-switch-or-err

1578945153
fengb
Looks like you'd effectively be doing both jsontree.root.deinit() and jsontree.deinit()

1578945164
metaleap
(can also note that the final call itself, that gets the `Allocator`, doesnt do any `deinit`s directly or indirectly, merely allocates new slices for the result structures)

1578945239
betawaffle
ok, so the fromJson(...) is getting called, returning, and then the last defer is the first thing to run, and fails?

1578945241
metaleap
fengb: yeah. that could be troublesome, will double-check the `std.json` code whether the latter already does the former. still surprised that the segfault is on the "first" (last in code positioning) of the 3 defer'd deinits

1578945250
fengb
I'd expect toplevel deinit() also invokes all the children deinit(), which would cause a double free

1578945269
fengb
We don't have good double free detection (yet)

1578945352
metaleap
betawaffle: yeah, segfault msg like this one:

1578945405
metaleap
fengb: i get that but scratching my head (as a side-quest i guess) why it would fault on the inner ("first" aka last) deinit rather than a (later) "top-level" one

1578945435
gonz_
BaroqueLarouche and anyone else who might be interested: RemedyBG has added better clang support and actually works with local values much more reliably in my limited testing than VS

1578945486
gonz_
Arbitrary watch values seem to just work. Presumably this is just a clang thing, then.

1578945575
betawaffle
metaleap: run it under gdb or lldb?

1578945659
betawaffle
i don't really understand that "address 0x3" part...

1578945660
metaleap
havent yet, will try

1578945663
BaroqueLarouche
gonz_: Nice!

1578945693
betawaffle
i mean, that would segfault, for sure. just not sure why it would try to deref that

1578945732
betawaffle
unless that's some sort of bug in the segfault printing

1578945778
gonz_
BaroqueLarouche: Granted, since I haven't really been able to use RemedyBG much before I have no idea what

1578945806
betawaffle
hmm, did metaleap leave?

1578945831
mq32
betawaffle, yep

1578945842
___
betawaffle: had a disconnect but should be back on?

1578945845
betawaffle
ok

1578945862
___
ooh i got a new nick, used to be metaleap. dangit

1578945874
betawaffle
my crazy idea is that `self.allocator` is null

1578945884
mq32
/nick metaleap

1578945884
mq32
helps

1578945905
metaleap
betawaffle: am back, had a disconnect, trying with lldb

1578945952
betawaffle
the 0x3 address and the `std.array_list.AlignedArrayList(std.json.Value,null).deinit` makes me think the allocator is null

1578946115
betawaffle
oh i see, that second param is just alignment

1578946187
metaleap
betawaffle: output lldb lines incoming:

1578946202
betawaffle
gist, not irc

1578946241
metaleap
ok

1578946265
betawaffle
heh, yeah it's just a null pointer deref

1578946351
metaleap
so must be somewhere in array_list.AlignedArrayList.deinit so must be its self.allocator

1578946408
betawaffle
metaleap: what version of zig are you using?

1578946438
metaleap
2-3 days ago --- 0.5.0+84e98405d

1578946495
metaleap
so if self.allocator is null the std.json package must have passed to the array_list's init a null allocator from what i can tell skimming the array_list src

1578946507
betawaffle
can you set a breakpoint just before the deinit and step in?

1578946572
metaleap
ok hang on

1578946607
betawaffle
i mean, in theory that shouldn't be possible

1578946685
metaleap
btw i just out-commented in (my local) std.array_list.zig the offending line in deinit and the segfault of course goes away, so you sure this is even the point to breakpoint? at that point the null is already fact

1578946721
betawaffle
well... we don't know it's null

1578946734
betawaffle
we want to confirm or deny that

1578946764
betawaffle
basically we want to see if self.allocator is 0

1578946789
betawaffle
(which shouldn't be possible)

1578946809
metaleap
ok 1 more thing, did you notice in the gist of the segfault the "/home/_/a/zig/lib/zig/std/special/c.zig:81:0: 0x3 in std.target.Target.isDarwin (c)" reference. well i'll try breakpointing now. not used to lldb/gdb so gimme a sec there with the man page

1578946810
betawaffle
and if it's not null... then i'm confused about what's going on

1578946832
betawaffle
yeah, that's the panic function, called from the segfault handler, i assume

1578946921
betawaffle
actually... maybe that's just the stack trace bug?

1578946967
metaleap
so for `break` needs absolute `.zig` path?

1578946994
betawaffle
dunno, i'm not very familiar with lldb (nor gdb)

1578947009
betawaffle
i think it supports multiple things, including addresses

1578947200
metaleap
betawaffle: just stepped into the deinit! stay tuned =)

1578947262
fengb
You could lldb run the program, and it'll catch the seg fault and let you trace the stack

1578947347
betawaffle
he already did that

1578947373
betawaffle
we know the stack, we're trying to figure out the state of a variable

1578947381
fengb
You can navigate the frame upward once it crashed

1578947407
fengb
And get to the function context with the null. No need to pre setup debugging points for that

1578947417
metaleap
so here's what happens, it jumps into std.mem.Allocator.free line 233, goes on ok for 234-236, then at 237 the next `step` gives these 3 lines: `signal SIGSEGV: invalid address (fault address: 0x3)`, `frame #0: 0x0000000000000003`, `error: memory read failed for 0x0`.  again thats line 237 in std.mem.Allocator.free

1578947465
fengb
At the crash, can you print the backtrace? (lldb) bt

1578947488
fengb
And navigate to the right frame — (lldb) up [n]

1578947520
metaleap
fengb: backtrace:

1578947547
betawaffle
unavailable... cool

1578947593
betawaffle
that 0x3 frame is weird...

1578947597
fengb
`up 1` followed by `p *self`

1578947664
metaleap
fengb: both added,

1578947683
betawaffle
the fuck

1578947704
betawaffle
that's a really garbage allocator :P

1578947710
fengb
Well 0x3 is the shrink

1578947724
betawaffle
right, but that's gonna be PROT_NONE

1578947749
metaleap
its an arena's .allocator in this case here btw if that matters

1578947768
betawaffle
it almost looks like it's been corrupted

1578947769
metaleap
aka `std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator)`

1578947812
metaleap
now that would also mean the top-level deinit would

1578947822
metaleap
(well, possibly)

1578947823
betawaffle
also... it seems like we could improve the stack traces on segfaults some

1578947837
betawaffle
it'

1578947845
betawaffle
it's missing the last frame at least

1578947867
fengb
Might be a red herring. Can you try  `up 1` => `po *self` again?

1578947888
metaleap
fengb: po or p?

1578947898
fengb
ArenaAllocator.free() is a noop so this shouldn't be invoking anything

1578947909
fengb
p, sorry

1578947953
metaleap
so the up 1 jumped back to arraylist's deinit ln 54 and then p *self gives: indirection requires pointer operand ('std.array_list.AlignedArrayList(std.json.Value,null)' invalid)

1578947985
betawaffle
oh, try just self

1578947991
betawaffle
it's not a pointer

1578948012
betawaffle
(which seems a little weird to me)

1578948040
metaleap


1578948060
fengb
Zig uses non-pointers when we don't need a ref. The compiler can optimize that into "pass by const ref" or "pass by pointer" depending on which optimizes better

1578948071
betawaffle
so `p *self.allocator`

1578948075
betawaffle
do*

1578948090
betawaffle
just want to make completely sure...

1578948108
betawaffle
i don't understand where those function addresses came from

1578948136
fengb
Yeah 0x3 is a weird function pointer address. I don't think that's even valid sicne it's unaligned

1578948151
betawaffle
it's not, and it's in the zero page

1578948162
andrewrk
an address like 0x3 happens when you take the address of a struct field, based on a null struct pointer

1578948163
metaleap
(std.mem.Allocator) $2 = { reallocFn = 0x0000000000000008 shrinkFn = 0x0000000000000003 }

1578948168
betawaffle
which is always unreadable

1578948173
metaleap
above for p *self.allocator

1578948195
betawaffle
yeah, makes sense andrewrk

1578948218
betawaffle
ok metaleap: so let's look at your code that creates the allocator

1578948270
metaleap
sure thing, it's bog-standard AFAIK:

1578948298
metaleap
some tmp rubbish in the middle as i got the hang of zig things, never mind that

1578948308
betawaffle
sure does look bog-standard

1578948319
fengb
So uh... based on your code, you never have to call free() if you know it's in the arena

1578948338
fengb
That doesn't exactly solve this problem, but it could simplify your strategy

1578948356
metaleap
but the func called at the end of main, which i shared originally in the gist, is supposed to become a lib that wont know the nature of the allocator

1578948406
fengb
So a trick that we can do is if you only have 1 entrypoint into your library, then it can create an arena at the beginning and that could be the only site that exposes the allocation

1578948521
fengb
It doesn't really teach you about lifetimes though as it more or less works around them

1578948526
metaleap
could do as a workaround, but then i can also keep the original offending deinit call commented as another workaround :D see I was just trying to learn if I did that part wrong and if so, why

1578948537
betawaffle
metaleap: let's set a breakpoint before load.FromJson to see what's in the allocator

1578948562
andrewrk
I'm not sure std.json.ValueTree is meant to be copied

1578948570
metaleap
so we still have the question mark why the std.mem.Allocator $2 above is evidently null at least as indicated by the 0x3 / 0x8 etc addrs?

1578948600
betawaffle
we'll it's the arena init that's setting those values

1578948646
betawaffle
which makes basically no sense

1578948666
metaleap
ok so I'll set a breakpoint just before load.FromJson 1 sec

1578948670
andrewrk
`as(std.json.Value.Array, std.json.Array, jsontree.root)` would be better written `switch (jsontree.root) { .Array => |*array| { ... }, else => return error.BadJsonSrc }`

1578948743
betawaffle


1578948752
andrewrk
yes also rootarr.deinit() is invalid. Appears to be undocumented, but the owner of all the memory of the array lists is the arena which is freed by jsontree.deinit()

1578948760
betawaffle
afaict, that's what should be in your allocator

1578948811
andrewrk
arguably these should be slices rather than std.ArrayList since they don't manage their own memory, and aren't resizable

1578948824
andrewrk
but maybe that's for writing json

1578948886
andrewrk
anyway correct fix is to delete the commented out code

1578948914
betawaffle
well, but there's also a bug elsewhere, isn't there?

1578949012
metaleap
andrewrk: thx for chiming in and clarifying the "appears to be undocumented" bit =) good to know. so then if the valuetree's deinit takes care of all its inner alloc'd `json.Value`s its odd that the same fault didnt occur

1578949047
metaleap
ah guess because it has an inner arena itself, ok

1578949420
metaleap
betawaffle: so at that breakpoint i get "more normal i guess" addresses 0x0000000000225460 and 0x0000000000225630 for reallocFn and shrinkFn

1578949466
metaleap
so that gets degraded at a later point. suppose i step and re-check per line in load.FromJson for giggles..

1578949507
andrewrk
metaleap, do you know about hardware watch points?

1578949512
betawaffle
yeah. also, it could be a different allocator at that point?

1578949529
andrewrk
if not this would be a good time to invest in learning how to use them, they're amazing

1578949658
metaleap
i'll make a note for that. first line of load.fromJson the passed *Allocator still prints the same 2 addrs.. stepping further

1578949938
metaleap
well so the rootarr.allocator is a pointer to an address different to my own allocator, so some std.json internal circus. thx to all for bearing =)

1578950362
mikdusan


1578950373
mikdusan
copying arena

1578950412
metaleap
sheesh it takes my arena's child allocator as its own arena's child allocator, ahum

1578950436
metaleap
is that normal practice?

1578950455
fengb
It is right now. In the future™, it'll detect whether its already in an arena

1578950492
fengb


1578950556
andrewrk
oh look at that, apparently I already solved this but needed the async rewrite first

1578950559
metaleap
ok i see. probably after my whole initial load stuff completes, i'll free / ditch my arena and make a new one for the rest of the run time then

1578951361
metaleap
last newcomer Q for the night: to clarify re andrewrk's earlier suggestion on my tag/type-`switch`ing: if I do say `switch (unionval) { ArrayListTag => |arrlist| fooSomeCodeHere(arrlist), else => unreachable }` unless I explicitly do pointer-notation as in |*arrlist| there'd be a copy made for the successful `switch` case?! ie whether struct or array or whatever, it doesnt operate directly on the union location but the |var| is a value copy, i mean

1578951361
metaleap
within / inside the switch case (ignoring / excluding any passing-to / returning-from any calls)?

1578951439
metaleap
I'd have expected whatever capture-name is given would refer to the same location as the union-val being scrutinized

1578951501
metaleap
(as in, "same, just-now-properly-typed")

1578951656
daurnimator
andrewrk: did my reply re: extern bitfields vs packed bitfields make sense?

1578951658
fengb
Right now I think |val| is no copy due to result location changes. This has been a footgun so we might be migrating

1578951767
andrewrk
yes currently |val| works the same as

1578951804
andrewrk
to guarantee copy, make a copy; to guarantee no-copy, use |*val|

1578951815
metaleap
ok thanks for clarifying!

1578952400
mikdusan
i think this is the fault cause in json:

1578952473
mikdusan
`arena` is stack. transition() does stuff, creating Array for example that retains `&arena.allocator`

1578952746
metaleap
mikdusan: but only Parser.stack gets deinit'd it's not like the whole inner arena gets cleared except in case of errdefer.. well i'm off, not seeing the forest for the trees anymore

1578952854
mikdusan
if you remove all defers (other deinit) ...and put in a manual `root.deinit()` it faults

1578952880
daurnimator
mikdusan: ah yes. looks like the old parser tree bug :)

1578952914
daurnimator
metaleap: did you get a chance to try the autojson branch?

1578952928
daurnimator
bah missed them by a second.

1578953622
Snektron
irc moment

1578954805
fengb
We definitely need pointer to stack escape analysis >_>

1578954922
andrewrk
agreed

1578955016
andrewrk
also explicit allowing/disallowing of aggregate types will help with this

1578955035
andrewrk
s/of/copying of/

1578956746
daurnimator
Is riscv freestanding meant to work?

1578956749
Snektron
I triggered a "put into full map" unreachable in HashMap, but im not quite sure what to make of it

1578956833
daurnimator


1578956864
andrewrk
Snektron, this can happen if you use putAssumeCapacity incorrectly

1578956908
andrewrk
daurnimator, your link script does not include "foo"

1578956937
Snektron
Yeah i assumed so, but i never call that

1578956956
andrewrk
other than that, either memory was corrupted or there is a bug in the hash map implementation

1578956972
Snektron
it was working until i refactored some of my code

1578956974
daurnimator
andrewrk: what link script? shouldn't all exported symbols just appear?

1578957005
andrewrk
daurnimator, what are you trying to do? are you sure you want an executable rather than an object? executables don't have "foo" sections

1578957029
andrewrk
most freestanding projects have linker scripts

1578957045
mikdusan
andrewrk: on ir_clean_up_vars, can you try re-run test/stage1/behavior/optional.zig multiple times? I'm getting sporadic failures

1578957056
daurnimator
andrewrk: I'm not even sure. Was just trying to play with riscv.....

1578957059
andrewrk
daurnimator,

1578957069
andrewrk
mikdusan, yes I'll try with valgrind

1578957142
fengb
andrewrk: do you get less money on donation if I use credit card vs bank?

1578957166
daurnimator
fengb: via github? I think github eat all the fees

1578957169
andrewrk
fengb, I don't think I can tell the difference; github is eating the fee for now afaik

1578957171
mikdusan
this one: Test [1/10] test "optional pointer to size zero struct"...test failure ; running same test executable from cache, 50/50 chance; maybe I need ECC memory :P

1578957189
fengb
Oh okay that works too

1578957203
andrewrk
mikdusan, I'm getting all behavioral tests valgrind clean in 27755f1431e6df

1578957219
mikdusan
ok I'll try on archlinux

1578957228
Snektron
ah, found the problem

1578957229
andrewrk
mikdusan, I've been force pushing to that branch fyi

1578957236
mikdusan
yup i have 27755

1578957243
Snektron
`const e = spec.enums.get(enum_name).?.value;`

1578957374
andrewrk
mikdusan, oh - valgrind reports a problem with "optional pointer to size zero struct" when I run the behavioral tests

1578957398
mikdusan
if I played bingo I'd yell something out right now

1578957413
andrewrk
I forgot about runtime, oops :)

1578957474
andrewrk
this warning is fun to see:

1578957482
andrewrk
Test [488/786] behavior.new_stack_call.test "calling a function with a new stack...==14005== Warning: client switching stacks?  SP change: 0x1ffeffc550 --> 0x339500

1578957494
andrewrk
why yes valgrind, thank you

1578957499
mikdusan
heh wow

1578957626
daurnimator
andrewrk: do we need to emit some valgrind annotation to silence that warning?

1578957703
andrewrk
not if that feature ends up getting scrapped before 1.0

1578957889
andrewrk
this branch has been considerably easier to debug

1578957892
andrewrk
I think it is an improvement

1578957905
andrewrk
adding ZigValue::dump() helped a lot

1578957983
andrewrk
mikdusan, fixed with a force push, good catch, thanks

1578957999
andrewrk
hopefully it's just this one test from misc.zig left + whatever is causing std lib tests to crash

1578958351
frmdstryr
Is there any way to cast a bound function to a function that doesn't take arguments?

Want to use a struct method as an IRQ handler and hoping to not have to use a lookup table

frmdstryr: bound functions tend to crash the compiler if you do much with them

1578958667
andrewrk
you'll be better off pretending that zig doesn't have bound functions for now

Also i just pulled and now am getting an error

frmdstryr
lib/zig/std/start.zig:25:13: error: expected 3 arguments, found 2

1578959091
frmdstryr
but i'm using the freestanding os, did something change?

1578959176
frmdstryr
Nevermind, cleaned and rebuilt, now it's fine

1578959237

frmdstryr, you probably didn't install the updated std files

read the part here about -DZIG_SKIP_INSTALL_LIB_FILES=ON:

fengb suggested to make this default earlier today and I agreed with it

Yeah I think I clicked build instead of install in KDevelop by accident

1578959515
frmdstryr
Unrelated but do you know of any "mini" event loops floating around to try on the freestanding os?

1578959535
frmdstryr
async uart would be nice :)

frmdstryr: I ported a C one to JS that you might find useful to port to zig

1578959729
daurnimator
if I can find it that is

1578959832
frmdstryr
yeah it'd be nice to have a look
