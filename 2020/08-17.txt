I'm trying to cast a union whose variants are all 32-bit packed structs to a u32, but the tag is part of it in safe builds and it ends up being size 5. Anyone know how to extract just the payload?

1597624221
Snektron
You could make it extern

1597624260
Snektron
That removes the tag even in safe builds, and gives it a defined layout

1597624291
pixelherodev
Alternately, you can get the specific type and cast that

1597624336
pixelherodev
e.g. if it's a union(enum) of a and b, where a and b are both 32-bit packed structs, you could do something like `switch (val) { .a => |v| @bitCast(u32, v)...}`

1597624488
eleanor-nb
Extern did not work. Will try switch.

1597625380
Snektron
Broken packed structs were the cause

1597626329
eleanor-nb
@intCast(u32, v.opcode) + (@intCast(u32, v.imm11) << 7) + (@intCast(u32, v.imm1_4) << 8) + (@intCast(u32, v.funct3) << 12) + (@intCast(u32, v.rs1) << 15) + (@intCast(u32, v.rs2) << 20) + (@intCast(u32, v.imm5_10) << 25) +     (@intCast(u32, v.imm12) << 31)

1597626355
eleanor-nb
We seriously need to fix those.

1597626379
pixelherodev
?

1597626386
pixelherodev
ahhh

1597626405
pixelherodev
the "fix" here is to get stage2 finished :P

1597627203
ky0ko_
is there an easy way that i can grab things like the target arch, host os, and build date as strings in zig

1597636025
daurnimator
ky0ko: build date is evil

1597639517
andrewrk
holy pull requests, batman!

1597639529
andrewrk
ya'll have been busy today

1597641597
andrewrk
pixelherodev, yes that's exactly right

1597641629
andrewrk
daurnimator, my personal opinion is that I'm fine with `inline` when the person has done performance testing

1597641654
andrewrk
which it appears is the case for frank's pr

1597641695
daurnimator
andrewrk: it didn't make a difference in release-fast; but did in release-safe

1597641711
daurnimator
he wants to leave it in there so that release-safe is fast

1597641714
daurnimator
is that.... reasonable?

1597641715
andrewrk
that's good enough for me

1597641811
andrewrk
it's possible for that to actually sabotage perf in a theoretical other implementation of the zig language, but it's also possible that it would be reasonable in all cases

1597641908
andrewrk
it's a bit of a smell because it actually limits what the compiler is allowed to do, possibly sabotaging a really sophisticated optimizing compiler. but that's all just theoretical vaporware, and it's pretty easy to adjust the code in the future if necessary. so personally, my policy is no inline, unless you need it semantically to elide call frames, or if you've tested perf and it measurably helps

1597641932
andrewrk
on the other hand there could be a possible argument about release-small getting worse

1597641998
andrewrk
I think in this specific case we should let jedist1 have his preference

1597642078
andrewrk
alright I for sure need to do a pull request merging day tomorrow

1597663528
KoljaKube
Is there a way to generate a function call? I have all information about the function at comptime, except the argument values.

1597663550
ifreund
@call()?

1597663593
KoljaKube
I can't seem to construct the tuple correctly

1597663668
ifreund
can't really help there without some context

1597663710
KoljaKube
Heh, sorry, give me a second

1597663881
KoljaKube
This is a mix of various trials, callProxy2 is probably the most relevant part:

1597663948
daurnimator
I don't think `args = args ++ ` works unless it was fixed?

1597663971
KoljaKube
I was surprised that didn't give me a compile error

1597664002
KoljaKube
Currently the code reaches the unreachable in line 35

1597664012
KoljaKube
printing "AT = []const u8" before that

1597664037
daurnimator
did you mean to switch on AT rather than T?

1597664066
KoljaKube
Yes, yes I did

1597664097
daurnimator
if args = args ++ works then

1597664100
KoljaKube
OK,

1597664145
KoljaKube
Hehe, seems like we are doing something similar ;-)

1597664154
daurnimator
that code isn't new ;)

1597664163
ifreund
args = args ++ x; can't work, the type of args would change

1597664195
daurnimator
ifreund: what if args was `anytype`?

1597664199
KoljaKube
Yeah, that's what I thought. I just tried it to see what the error would be

1597664229
daurnimator
anyway, the way I solved it (as I linked above) is with comptime recursion to build args

1597664247
ifreund
daurnimator: not sure what the intended semantics are there.

1597664271
ifreund
maybe that would be ok, but it feel strange to me

1597664279
daurnimator


1597664478
ifreund
hmm, I can't init an anytype to an empty tuple

1597664618
daurnimator
ifreund: even with a value in there I get error: array access of non-array type '(anytype)'

1597664708
ifreund
daurnimator: got it working

1597664775
ifreund
I kinda hate it though :D

1597664799
daurnimator
ifreund: cannot store runtime value in compile time variable

1597664809
daurnimator
^ if you use something non-comptime known

1597664852
ifreund
hmm, yeah that would make sense

1597664935
daurnimator
ifreund:

1597664970
ifreund
oh, nice idea

1597665187
daurnimator


1597665230
ifreund
I think that does it no?

1597665251
daurnimator
yep; that works

1597665259
daurnimator
hacks on hacks :P

1597665279
ifreund
hey why you givind ikskuh the credit in the issue? :P

1597665286
daurnimator
oh whoops

1597665289
daurnimator
you both start with i

1597665301
ikskuh
:D

1597665387
daurnimator
I wonder if I should actually commit that to autolua

1597665445
ifreund
I guess it's cleaner than the recursive way

1597665468
ifreund
I wonder how andrewrk will feel about it

1597665504
daurnimator
with any luck he'll make it so all the 'magic' there gets made redundant

1597665519
ifreund
also, it makes a decent argument for allowing anytype variables outside of structs

1597665520
daurnimator
e.g. why can't you put the type in directly as an initialiser?

1597665531
daurnimator
why do you need a struct member of anytype instead of an actual variable of type anytype?

1597665537
daurnimator
^ yeah exactly

1597665555
ifreund
maybe we can even get the ++= proposal

1597665583
daurnimator
I wonder if its too much sending a PR to std.meta to add that AnyType? :P

1597665686
ifreund
I think if it's not considered an antipattern it would indeed belong in std

1597665702
ifreund
It certainly has a real use case for language bindings

1597666226
KoljaKube
I can't figure out how to fill that ArgType tuple :-/

1597666648
daurnimator
KoljaKube: what do you mean?

1597666842
KoljaKube
Assigning the tuple fields in a loop, using their respective types

1597667491
daurnimator
hmm yeah you're right

1597667498
daurnimator
I keep getting "cannot assign to constant"

1597667652
KoljaKube
Me too

1597667693
KoljaKube
autolua does not have license. Is it OK to "borrow" wrap?

1597668063
ifreund
hmm, I get the same error, but I don't see why

1597668604
daurnimator
KoljaKube: sure

1597668663
KoljaKube
Thanks!

1597669396
ifreund
rip, casting around the const segfaults

1597669476
ifreund
with --release-fast it doesn't crash but instead prints garbage

1597671233
pixelherodev
In C, if I have a struct, the address of the first member is defined as the address of the struct, so I can ptrCast between them at will - but Zig structs don't have defined layouts, right?

1597671383
pixelherodev
andrewrk: do we have any concrete plans for an abstraction over the various allocations in link.zig?

1597671396
pixelherodev
If not, I'm about to make the situation

1597672275
daurnimator
pixelherodev: your first statement there is correct

1597672307
daurnimator
pixelherodev: *however*, currently zig structs do layout in order; doing it in optimized order/adding things for debugging is an open TODO

1597672335
daurnimator
ifreund's error message suggests to me that tuples with comptime known members get 0 runtime size

1597672381
fengb
They do. It takes quite a bit of effort to build a dynamic tuple type

1597672741
fengb


1597672775
fengb
Gotta convince the compiler the value is not comptime known so this escapes with a "stack variable"

1597672942
pixelherodev
daurnimator: that's not defined though.

1597672967
pixelherodev
It's behavior that exists presently in the

1597673002
daurnimator
well yeah

1597673012
daurnimator
that's what I said

1597673039
pixelherodev
Point being that we should act as if that's not present for now

1597673050
pixelherodev


1597673065
daurnimator
it was used as a (failed) hack around a compiler bug

1597673070
fengb
Let’s randomize the layout :P

1597673080
daurnimator
use one bug to fight another

1597673090
fengb
Although that might be tricky with incremental compilation

1597673157
daurnimator
fengb: use the buildid as a seed

1597673428
pixelherodev
I think it's worth defining the first member as at the same address as the struct itself, and optimizing everything

1597673444
pixelherodev
There's a number of useful tricks that allows that make it easier to write cleaner code

1597674145
pixelherodev
A good example is with multiple struct types with a shared interface (e.g. link.File in stage2)

1597674199
pixelherodev
If we had such a definition, its `destroy` function could become `base.deinit();base.allocator.destroy(base):` instead of a switch requiring three lines for each possible link file type

1597674216
pixelherodev
Though the destruction might be trickier, since the size would be different...

1597676245
daurnimator
ooo

1597676359
pixelherodev
Nice

1597681410
KoljaKube
I hate compiler crashes :-/

1597684103
pixelherodev
ifreund, andrewrk: ping

1597684700
ifreund
pong

1597684790
pixelherodev
For wasm codegen, did you handle debug info?

1597684797
pixelherodev
s/codegen/updateDecl

1597684929
pixelherodev
Hmm, doesn't look like it (found the PR :)

1597684967
pixelherodev
Ah, I see what you did

1597684970
pixelherodev
Drats, doesn't help me

1597685486
ifreund
sorry to disappoint :P

1597685555
pixelherodev
no worries :P

1597685563
pixelherodev
I'm just going to end up generating debug info and then discarding it, apparently

1597690295
pixelherodev
andrewrk, ifreund, alexnask[m]: proposal, after talking with ikskuh elsewhere re: spu-ii backend. Instead of adding a HEX backend, a PE backend, a MACH-O, etc; we refactor link.File.Elf into an "abstract binary" output - that is, fully separate codegen from linking. We produce raw code + debug info into an in-memory structure, and then have a separate structure containing either ELF, PE, HEX, etc.

1597690297
pixelherodev
This should still be doable incrementally with miniscule or no overhead, and simplifies the logic drastically. I pinged you all because IIRC you're all working on relevant components which would be affected by such work (DWARF, PE, etc)

1597690412
pixelherodev
It means a lot of code deduplication as well, since we don't need e.g. TextBlock logic per link file type

1597690425
pixelherodev
Thoughts?

1597691056
ifreund[m]
probably won’t work for wasm, from what I’ve seen of elf

1597691085
ifreund[m]
could be a very good move for the rest though

1597691394
ikskuh
ifreund[m], can you explain the differences required for wasm (and thus: other target types as well)

1597691413
ikskuh
there is also JVM and .NET formats to consider

1597691431
ikskuh
which require even more metadata than Wasm

1597691709
ifreund[m]
well, for wasm the codegen is very closely tied to how things are laid out in the binary. Even with the indirection used for function calls many other things rely on indexes into arrays of items in the binary

1597691738
ifreund[m]
I don’t seem a way to make a good abstraction over that way of doing things and elf

1597691884
pixelherodev
ifreund[m]: how's that different from the GOT?

1597691947
ifreund[m]
well, there’s no way to do indirection for globals in wasm for example

1597692011
pixelherodev
Ahh, so you

1597692088
ifreund[m]
not for everything

1597692103
ifreund[m]
for functions there’s a way to do it

1597692151
ifreund[m]
i have a vague idea of how we might be able to just not use globals, but not too sure about that yet

1597693225
pixelherodev
Even if it's not good for WASM, it can still simplify ihex, PE, ELF, etc

1597693400
pixelherodev
andrewrk, alexnask[m]: would love to hear your thoughts when you have a chance

1597693740
ifreund
pixelherodev: so to make sure I'm clear on the proposal, the idea is to codegen into a buffer in memory and the rewrite the file on every update from this memory, saving the in-memory generated code across compilations?

1597693768
ifreund
Thinking about this a bit more and I think it could work for wasm, we just have to be a bit smarter

1597693816
ifreund
could actually simplify things a good deal and would certainly lead to smaller generated file sizes

1597693899
ifreund
the idea would be that we use some custom escape sequence in the wasm codegen which we could check for when writing from the in-memory buffer to the file and replace with the proper index for that round of generation

1597694032
pixelherodev
ifreund: for wasm, it could also separate wasm the

1597694042
pixelherodev
You could more tightly integrate wasm codegen with the normal pipeline

1597694055
pixelherodev
It wouldn't be rewriting the file fully on every update

1597694065
pixelherodev
For ELF, it would basically maintain all the info we have currently

1597694073
pixelherodev
So it

1597694074
andrewrk
pixelherodev, this is too complicated for IRC, if you want this idea to happen, I suggest to open a proposal on the issue tracker. the better you explain things, the better the chance of it happening

1597694096
pixelherodev
andrewrk: makes sense, I'll do so at some point today, a bit busy with Coyote rn

1597694101
andrewrk
fair enough

1597694109
pixelherodev
Give me an hour or two :)

1597694186
ifreund
pixelherodev: I'm not sure you can separate wasm the architecture from wasm the format, they are very tightly coupled

1597694224
pixelherodev
ifreund: the more I hear about WASM, the more I wish they'd just used something like RISC-V with a custom ABI

1597694230
ifreund
I don't think there any other format for the wasm "architecture" and you certianly cant put any random byte code in the wasm format

1597694253
pixelherodev
Wasm byte code can still exist in a ArrayList(u8) separate from the file though

1597694268
pixelherodev
The only thing special about wasm is the fact that people actually agreed to use it

1597694274
ifreund
true

1597694281
pixelherodev
Any ISA would've been good for that, if people would just agree on it

1597694293
companion_cube
wasm doesn't have the limitations a real ISA does, does it?

1597694297
companion_cube
like number of registers

1597694308
ifreund
nope you get infinite

1597694321
pixelherodev
You could also do that with e.g. LLVM IR

1597694325
companion_cube
so it's higher level

1597694326
ifreund
and its also inherently sandboxed

1597694326
pixelherodev
Or any other SSA form

1597694333
companion_cube
pixelherodev: LLVM IR is what NaCl was

1597694340
companion_cube
and it's bad because it's unstable

1597694342
pixelherodev
I didn't mean

1597694349
pixelherodev
Of course LLVM IR is a terrible choice for it lol

1597694361
pixelherodev
There's a reason I've largely ditched my LLVM backend

1597694434
pixelherodev
TBH, Wasm amuses me greatly

1597694441
pixelherodev
It's a technical solution to a social problem :P

1597694644
companion_cube
it's great that there is such a solution

1597695524
ifreund
pixelherodev: your proposal is also the only way I see to reasonably apply multithreading to wasm

1597695701
fengb
The web was the only place to get a bunch of devs to agree on any standard >_>

1597695765
fengb
And by a bunch, I really just mean Emscripten + Google + Mozilla. I'm not sure how they strongarmed Safari into it

1597695857
pixelherodev
fengb: POSIX. SystemV. RISC-V. I can keep going :P

1597695861
Sahnvour
andrewrk: have you had a chance to look at #5999 ?

1597695873
fengb
None of those are widespread binary standards

1597695939
andrewrk
Sahnvour, breifly - planning to do a deeper dive today. I agree with your conclusion that there is use for both implementations

1597695944
fengb
I'd love to see RISCV develop further, but adoption hasn't really taken off yet

1597696085
Sahnvour
okay

1597696155
companion_cube
oh god, apparently in C you can use `-1` as a literal for an unsigned integer?

1597696163
companion_cube
to express "all bits to one"?!

1597696179
ifreund
companion_cube: yeah that's a common pattern

1597696190
companion_cube
that's… horrible

1597696195
Sahnvour
life is too short to type all those FF

1597696201
companion_cube
(and people say C is simple, lol)

1597696205
ifreund
it is

1597696229
ifreund
though zig is simpler

1597696279
companion_cube
I don't call these kinds of smartassery "simple" :p

1597696314
fengb
Simple for the bits. Your semantics be damned

1597696334
ifreund
It's easier than counting out all the F's

1597696353
ifreund
the semantics are simple: overflow is well defined for unsigned integers

1597696368
ifreund
well, underflow in this case but you get the point

1597696424
ifreund
I guess one could argue that MAX_INT or whatever should be used instead

1597696428
companion_cube
in rust you write `!0` apparently

1597696452
ifreund
not as nice as std.math.maxInt(u32) though

1597696453
companion_cube
yeah, max int would be more logical

1597696463
companion_cube
I mean, a

1597696500
jayschwa
~0 seems clearer in my opinion

1597696501
fengb
!0 is max?

1597696513
companion_cube
jayschwa: yeah anyway, bitwise not

1597696514
fengb
Ah I like ~0

1597696561
ifreund
~0 is better indeed

1597696580
fengb
Although... are literals defined as ints? short max isn't the same as ~int

1597696637
pixelherodev
companion_cube: `0 - 1` is valid for unsigneds

1597696639
pixelherodev
(in C)

1597696701
andrewrk
~0 works in zig but you have to give an integer type

1597696701
ikskuh
writing "~0" in c is equivalent to "-1"

1597696708
andrewrk
~@as(T, 0)

1597696726
andrewrk
i wish @as was syntactically cleaner

1597696746
ikskuh
andrewrk: I think the function call syntax was cleaner

1597696759
ikskuh
~T(0)

1597696770
ikskuh
but i understand why it was removed

1597696782
companion_cube
pixelherodev: 0 - 1 is not the same as `-1`

1597696793
companion_cube
(or so I hope)

1597696906
ikskuh
companion_cube: why should that be different?

1597696921
companion_cube
one is a literal, a raw value; the other one is an expression

1597696925
companion_cube
(which underflows)

1597696935
companion_cube
so I'd say `0-1` should be allowed

1597696951
companion_cube
but `-1` in an unsigned type is like allowing `42` in the bool type

1597696989
ikskuh
well, for C it's the same outcome anyways

1597696992
ikskuh
for zig as well

1597697006
ikskuh
"0-1" is evaluated to "comptime_int -1"

1597697010
KoljaKube
Why was the function call syntax removed? Language simplicity?

1597697013
ikskuh
so it's the same as writing "-1"

1597697033
ikskuh
KoljaKube: yeah, it removed the ambiguity of "func(foo)" and "cast(foo)"

1597697044
ikskuh
soo "foo(bar)" is

1597697059
KoljaKube
Mhkay

1597697096
KoljaKube
It

1597697102
ikskuh
yeah

1597697116
ikskuh
i also like `as` as a binary operator:

1597697118
ikskuh
"10 as i32"

1597697139
ifreund
the you need parens though

1597697163
ifreund
(10 as i32) + 5 vs @as(i32, 10) + 5

1597697178
ikskuh
same number of parens :D

1597697184
ifreund
unless you make it super high precedence, but then it lookes weird

1597697197
ikskuh
nah i think it should bind quite tight

1597697213
ifreund
so 5 + 10 as i32

1597697232
ikskuh
hm

1597697253
ikskuh
there#s the ambiguity proposal with the operator precedence parens enforcement thingy

1597697270
ikskuh
which would enforce parens anyways

1597697286
pixelherodev
ikskuh: it's always a wat?

1597697288
pixelherodev
;)

1597697289
ikskuh
so you could do "(5 + 10) as i32" or "5 + (10 as i32)"

1597697292
pixelherodev
"function cast" ;)

1597697324
ikskuh
oh

1597697458
KoljaKube
TypeInfo.ErrorUnion is the type of !foo, right?

1597697474
pixelherodev
Not quite

1597697479
pixelherodev
!foo

1597697502
pixelherodev
TypeInfo.ErrorUnion is the type of @typeInfo(!foo) IIRC

1597697520
pixelherodev
Or possible @typeInfo(!foo).ErrorUnion ?

1597697520
KoljaKube
OK, yeah, I misspoke

1597698295
pixelherodev
Time for the Great Writeup.

1597698298
pixelherodev
This will be fun

1597699580
pixelherodev
andrewrk: filed as #6079 :)

1597700610
ifreund
you know, it would be kinda useful to have slices with u32 len instead of usize for wasm stuff

1597700629
ifreund
I don't like having all the @intCasts

1597701043
andrewrk
yeah I know

1597701130
ifreund
good news is that I fixed that problem I commented about

1597701157
ifreund
just need to figure out how to fit my commit message summary in 50 chars then i will push it :D

1597701463
fengb
"did stuff"

1597701569
ifreund
I guess the next thing to do is to figure out how to write wasm test cases

1597701595
ifreund
incremental compilation works for my trivial code

1597701601
andrewrk
nice!

1597701610
ikskuh
\o/

1597701618
pixelherodev
Nicely done!

1597701674
pixelherodev
I got progress on ihex backend today, but I need to wait for the results of the proposal before I go further

1597701692
pixelherodev
What I might do instead is work on an ELF loader so I can do SPU II work w/o an ihex backend

1597701710
pixelherodev
Doesn't even need an

1597701744
ifreund
how bad would it be to keep all the code generated in memory and rewrite the output file from the in memory code on each update?

1597701962
andrewrk
ifreund, main idea there is to reduce memory usage

1597702016
companion_cube
ifreund: sounds like a job for memory-map :p

1597702036
andrewrk
it's very difficult to handle errors properly with memory mapping files

1597702049
ifreund
yeah that's the downside. This would make things significantly simpler for wasm and is the only reasonable thing I've currently thought up to make multithreading possible

1597702053
andrewrk
ifreund, that being said, even zig with llvm compiled in, stripped, is 122MiB. so maybe it's worth considering

1597702080
andrewrk
I would be on board with exploring this approach for wasm

1597702096
ifreund
the idea would be to do codegen in parallel inserting some custom escape sequence for function ids

1597702128
ifreund
then write all the code to the file replacing the escape sequences with the right ids

1597702189
andrewrk
makes sense

1597702190
ifreund
goes for all the stuff wasm uses indexes for really, not just functions

1597702233
andrewrk
so flush would be doing a lot of work, but mostly copying already-computed bytes

1597702237
andrewrk
right?

1597702246
ifreund
yeah that's right

1597702253
andrewrk
yeah that's perfectly reasonable

1597702261
ifreund
we'd also generate much smaller binaries

1597702278
andrewrk
if that's the case it might actually be faster compiler perf

1597702302
andrewrk
it's planned anyway to have a way to serialize the in-memory state so that you don't have to keep the compiler alive to do incremental compilation. so this strategy I think is in line with the design

1597702321
ifreund
yeah, there'd also be no copying around data within the output file

1597702361
andrewrk
elf is unusually flexible; before diving into it I was expecting to have to do a strategy like you are describing, having the incrementally updated thing be a bespoke file format that zig uses

1597702417
andrewrk
the bespoke file format being the thing that zig serializes its in-memory data between compilations

1597702429
ifreund
yeah makes sense

1597702499
ifreund
we could also potentially write this data to disk right away and then copy between files in low-memory situations

1597702816
andrewrk
yep I think it's a reasonable design path to go down

1597702868
Snektron
Whats an allocFn's len_align supposed to be when @sizeOf(T) > 1<<29?

1597702879
Snektron
What was the reasoning for u29 anyway?

1597702968
andrewrk


1597702968
ifreund
alright so I guess I'll see this initial wasm PR through to the end (just need test cases) and then I'll get to work on the redesign :D

1597703009
andrewrk
Snektron, len_align should almost always be 0

1597703075
andrewrk
ifreund, if you do `./zig build test-stage2 -Denable-wasmtime` then it should already be hooked up to run them

1597703081
ifreund
oh lol, andrewrk's fancy new allocator just reminded me that I forgot to deinit() my new ArrayList

1597703096
andrewrk
get rekt

1597703107
fengb
I need to update zee_alloc yet again :(

1597703117
fengb
Bit rot is real

1597703120
ifreund
andrewrk: sweet, the challenge will just be reading and understanding the test harness then

1597703150
andrewrk
ifreund, you might be able to just add a case to test/stage2/compare_output.zig and not really worry about the harness

1597703165
Snektron
andrewrk: it seems like the len_align is calculated regardless

1597703171
Snektron
For large allocations that results in an overflow

1597703185
Snektron
I'd fix it, but i don't know the exact intention

1597703191
ifreund
andrewrk: that looks promising, do you know if I can pass args to wasmtime?

1597703206
ifreund
right now I'm testing with wasmtime --invoke main

1597703305
andrewrk
ifreund, rebase to after 96a27557e2ef53b8d1d3132f02c83b716c966277 which I just pushed

1597703335
ifreund
will do

1597703354
andrewrk
I believe that wasmtime will invoke _start by default

1597703359
andrewrk
can you just name your function _start?

1597703459
ifreund
oh I think you're right, will see if it also prints the return value of the function once I resolve conflicts with the macho stuff which touched adjacent lines

1597703893
andrewrk
Snektron, hmm that's an important bug find, thanks for reporting. have you looked at the doc comments on mem.Allocator? they explain the purpose of len_align

1597703992
Snektron
yes, but what i mean is what len_align is supposed to be for those large allocations

1597704008
Snektron
If its fixed to always be 0, a part of the interface is lost

1597704050
pixelherodev
andrewrk: I have no issue with waiting for you to do it :)

1597704126
pixelherodev
It does mean that ihex is on hold

1597704127
andrewrk
Snektron, if it's a large allocation of u8 then it would be len_align=1 so no problem there

1597704135
pixelherodev
So I

1597704140
pixelherodev
a good way to do a *

1597704156
Snektron
A right, i was trying to allocate a large buffer with static size

1597704156
andrewrk
the problematic situation we're talking about would be a struct whose abi size was greater than 1 << 29 which is pretty wild

1597704159
ifreund
I was gonna say, that might be hard to find :D

1597704167
Snektron
[1024][1024][1024]u8

1597704202
andrewrk
in this case the existence of len_align is pure overhead

1597704218
andrewrk
the only problem it is supposed to solve is allowing allocators to return more bytes than requested

1597704267
andrewrk
but the problem is if you request an array of 10 Foos you don't want the allocator to give you 10.5 Foos back

1597704304
pixelherodev
I mean, I'd be impressed if it did. Especially if a Foo was a u1 :P

1597704307
Snektron
Why not? can't the extra memory be used for something else

1597704328
pixelherodev
no

1597704333
pixelherodev
Not really

1597704337
pixelherodev
[10.5]u8

1597704339
pixelherodev
??

1597704345
pixelherodev
What are you going to use the rest of the memory for, a u4?

1597704359
Snektron
Not in that case obviously

1597704394
pixelherodev
you mean e.g. [10.5]u16 storing an extra u8?

1597704396
Snektron
Hm, i suppose i'm mixing up between the user interface of an allocator and its implementation

1597704399
pixelherodev
There's no real reason to do that though

1597704412
pixelherodev
The cost of handling that in code would exceed any gains

1597704438
Snektron
No, what i was thinking of was allocator A requesting memory from allocator B, where B returns extra memory which in turn can be used by A

1597704444
pixelherodev
ahh

1597704447
Snektron
but in that case you'd request an u8 anyway i suppose

1597704453
pixelherodev
Huh

1597704461
pixelherodev
That's a pretty good reason for allocators to always request u8s :P

1597704463
Snektron
slice of u8*

1597704718
andrewrk
len_align is irrelevant to u8s

1597704725
andrewrk
it matters for structs which have >1 abi size

1597704766
andrewrk
I think I should do some perf testing with ArrayList and GeneralPurposeAllocator and if removal of len_align doesn't really impact anything then it should be removed

1597704805
andrewrk
it would be a shame to overengineer allocators for nothing

1597705304
Snektron
Its an interesting point on how to handle stuff like that

1597705329
Snektron
I assume the main effect you want to create is returning an array close to page_size when allocating an ArrayList from a PageAllocator

1597705339
andrewrk
yeah that was one of the motivating use cases

1597705362
Snektron
I've thought about that before, the simplest solution i could think of involved adding a simple '

1597705370
Snektron
'preferred size' field to the allocator

1597705382
Snektron
But i imagine that it can benefit from having that be decided dynamically

1597705382
pixelherodev
I'm thinking for Thor 0.2 (rewriting it now!) I should load raw RISC-V and remove the builders entirely, and take a page from stage2's book and generate machine code directly instead of overengineering and using a builder + assembler again...

1597705405
Snektron
One situation i can imagine is having a node-based allocator return the extra space if theres some extra space left

1597705421
Snektron
but the problem becomes how to decide to return that vs keep it and manually performing the extra allocation

1597705438
Snektron
i mean saving that memory for other allocation calls

1597705458
pixelherodev
allow_extra: bool

1597705460
pixelherodev
?

1597705476
pixelherodev
Basically, the caller tells the allocator whether the caller has a use for any extra memory

1597705537
Snektron
Yes, but then you run into the issue of returning [10.5]Foo

1597705550
Snektron
So i suppose thats what len_align is for now

1597705576
Snektron
(with len_align = 0 for allow_extra = false)

1597705622
pixelherodev
andrewrk: idea for codegen: all the various gen* functions should call genAsm with comptime-known arguments instead of generating raw bytes. This means genSetReg would turn into genAsm("mov", .{blah}) for instance

1597705637
pixelherodev
This makes the source much more readable and removes the need for a lot of the comments that are currently in place

1597705653
pixelherodev
Or, at the least, consolidates them all in one place

1597705661
pixelherodev
This one I'm happy to tackle if you think it's a good idea

1597705675
andrewrk
I'd like to avoid comptime string manipulation here

1597705750
pixelherodev
It wouldn't really be manipulation, it'd be exact comparison (e.g. all forms of mov would have

1597705762
Snektron
Wouldn't that just result in a giant switch on the name in genAsm?

1597705767
pixelherodev
basically, yeah

1597705769
pixelherodev
That's the idea

1597705779
Snektron
Sounds like overengineering to me

1597705790
pixelherodev
Not quite - this is purely for readability

1597705801
pixelherodev
to avoid having, say, `0x49, 0x83, 0x19`

1597705812
pixelherodev
That'd become `genAsm("blah")`

1597705826
pixelherodev
I don't really care how we achieve it, I just think it'd be useful to make it more readable

1597705833
ifreund
I mean, comments can go a long way

1597705849
pixelherodev
Yes, but they're duplicated

1597705853
pixelherodev
e.g. x64 REX comments

1597705853
ifreund
or just a namespace filled with constants

1597705891
pixelherodev
We do stuff like `SOME_CONSTANT | (@as(u8, reg.id()) << 3) | @as(u8, r2.id()`

1597705899
pixelherodev
)

1597706042
Snektron
I'd extract into functions which do exactly that

1597706064
Snektron
and just return a [N]u8

1597706579
andrewrk
remember every problem you solve is opportunity cost for other problems

1597706611
andrewrk
and there are some important problems left to solve in stage2

1597706645
pixelherodev
True

1597706781
pixelherodev
Are astgen structs blocked on anything?

1597706948
ifreund
when does link.File.file get set to null?

1597706984
ifreund
it's happening between my test cases but not during manual incremental updates with --watch

1597707045
pixelherodev
grep for it?

1597707048
pixelherodev
I can look if you want

1597707058
pixelherodev
Ahh

1597707061
pixelherodev
It happens in makeExecutable

1597707082
pixelherodev
It has to close it (and then set it to null) so it can be run - but makeExecutable shouldn't be called for wasm...

1597707108
pixelherodev
ifreund: you need to change makeExecutable into a nop for wasm

1597707115
pixelherodev
link.File.makeExecutable

1597707121
ifreund
yeah that's totally it, thanks

1597707136
pixelherodev
Np :)

1597707140
pixelherodev
Always happy to help

1597707532
ifreund
now the real question is why wasmtime outputs what I assume is floats interpreted as integers instead of formatting the float

1597707548
ifreund
e.g. 1109917696 instead of 42.0 as a f32

1597707566
ifreund
(it's not my code that's causing this, happens with handwritten wasm as well)

1597707688
ifreund
and yep just checked. that's the IEEE-754 representation of 42.0 interpreted as an unsigned integer
