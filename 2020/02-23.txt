lsp progress for the day: got the symbols-listing/hierarchy/outline to a useful-enough (and seemingly unbugged for now) state for me

1582416993
metaleap
with that and fmt in place, finally can move on to the harder but higher-payoff features.

1582423033
pixelherodev
So I had a bright idea which is probably going to make life a lot easier: going through the upstream LLVM lexer to ensure mine matches its behavior :)

1582423078
pixelherodev
Was actually more interested in the AST than the lexer, as I was having a bit of trouble working out a good design for the AST

1582427126
pixelherodev
Hmm. So apparently, enums don't show up in gdb correctly :(

1582427140
pixelherodev
`print token.token_type` -> `.TailMarker`, but stepping through the code it follows the correct path

1582427149
pixelherodev
That is, the value is correct, but GDB reports it incorrectly

1582427510
pmwhite
That was my experience as well.

1582427923
pixelherodev
pmwhite, any suggestions?

1582427998
pixelherodev
Ah, found a way

1582428013
pixelherodev
Take the address, cast to enum tag type, dereference

1582428318
pmwhite
I never actually worked around it, so that's helpful.

1582428358
pmwhite
Is gdb scriptable at all? Like, could you make a custom command or something for that?

1582428384
pixelherodev
I think so?

1582428388
pixelherodev
Found the root of the problem though

1582428390
pixelherodev
The address is wrong

1582428392
pmwhite
Not sure if that would save much effort.

1582428408
pixelherodev
That is, if you have `const a = struct { b: ENUMTYPE }`:

1582428447
pixelherodev
Where A is an instance of `a`: `print *(unsigned char*)(&A)` gives the correct result, but `print *(unsigned char*)(&A.b)` doesn't

1582428465
pixelherodev
because the address of A.b in the debug info is incorrect'

1582428498
pixelherodev
Filing bug report now

1582430893
pixelherodev
What's the difference between `const a: fn()void` and `const a: (fn()void)*`?

1582430918
daurnimator
You're about to multiply the second one? :P

1582431018
pixelherodev
Rephrase: are they both just function pointers?

1582431029
daurnimator
The second one is going to be a compile error isn't it?

1582431034
pixelherodev
I don't think so

1582431040
pixelherodev
IIRC that's what I used for something in my kernel

1582431045
pixelherodev
But I haven't touched that in a while so...

1582431054
daurnimator
did you mean `const a: *(fn()void)`

1582431081
pixelherodev
Retraction: nope, it's not

1582431088
pixelherodev
Yeah

1582431098
pixelherodev
Would that be a pointer to a function pointer, or a function pointer?

1582431110
pixelherodev
function pointer or a pointer to one *

1582431113
pmwhite
Former

1582431123
pixelherodev
Alright, thankses

1582431155
pmwhite
Fn types are already function pointers I believe.

1582431202
pmwhite
Because you can't move function values, so they always have to be pointers.

1582431246
pixelherodev
Right, makes sense

1582431252
pixelherodev
Just wanted to clarify

1582431269
pmwhite
So there is no point to adding extra syntax to indicate that it is a pointer. This is my understanding anyway.

1582431414
daurnimator
pmwhite: so..... why

1582431518
daurnimator
like.... I should be able to do: `const func = try mmap(...., @sizeOf(somefunc), ... │PROT_EXEC,....); func.* = somefunc; func.*();`

1582431779
pixelherodev
Relative addresses will be incorrect

1582431884
pixelherodev
Simply put, it requires ABI guarantees which don't exist

1582432340
pmwhite
Not sure what the use of moving function would be anyway.

1582432475
pixelherodev
Well, combined with CRNG, could be used for security?

1582432500
pixelherodev
Have a hook at the beginning of main that automatically relocates all functions to randomized offsets, rewriting addresses

1582432511
pixelherodev
s/addresses/addresses

1582432532
pixelherodev
that is, if main calls `a()`, and a is relocated to DEADCODE, the call would be rewritten

1582432641
pixelherodev
I am explicitly not saying this is a good idea

1582433655
pmwhite
As in, you are making no judgement of its goodness?

1582433874
pixelherodev
s/.*/This is definitely a bad idea though/

1582434592
daurnimator


1582435196
pixelherodev
That sounds like a compiler-rt function

1582435291
pixelherodev
Zig probably has a port of

1582435578
daurnimator
pixelherodev: note the `--bundle-compiler-rt` argument: it should have bundled it in.... but I don't see it there

1582435671
pixelherodev
Ahh, right

1582447078
daurnimator
Why is riscv32 tier 4 instead of tier 3?

1582451913
Snektron
In what situation would Allocator.realloc be called with new_size < old_mem.size ?

1582451943
Snektron
I noticed that in PageAllocator, realloc just calls shrink if thats the case, and the new alignment is smaller (or equal)

1582452005
Snektron
But every buffer returned by the PageAllocator should be page aligned right? So that would mean shrink can be called if the new alignment is smaller or equal to the page alignment (or whatever alignment the buffer just happened to be)

1582452057
Snektron
assumed old_align is the alignment requested on the previous alignment and not what the buffer happened to be

1582452660
Snektron
I think something is wrong with my linux installation, because if i recompile Zig it starts to rebuild everything regardless of what changed

1582452769
mikdusan
hmm... I've only ever seen "unconditional-like" rebuilds when system clock has been changed radically, or something wrong with it (not in zig build specifically, just depenendencies in general)

1582452783
mikdusan
sometimes a network share is involved

1582452814
Snektron
mkdusan, i've noticed it happens with other projects as well

1582452826
Snektron
The strange thing is that its usually fixed if i use gcc instead of clang

1582452829
Snektron
but not with Zig

1582452849
mikdusan
.ccache ?

1582452852
Snektron
afaik my system clock is normal, and everythink is on my local ssd

1582452895
Snektron
I'm not using ccache on either my laptop or desktop

1582452998
mikdusan
any special filesystem mounting options used?

1582453006
Snektron
not that i know of

1582453149
Snektron
Does zig support va_arg functions yet?

1582453152
mikdusan
this is a very generic lead; maybe whatever file is in the dependency chain being updated, is not actually being updated because of some permissions problem

1582453262
Snektron
hmm, maybe

1582453291
Snektron
i'd expect something to throw an error about not being able to write that file though

1582453310
mikdusan
"rebuild everything" . do you mean using zig.exe to build things, or using cmake/clang to build zig.exe ?

1582453346
daurnimator
Snektron: you mean why would you shrink memory?

1582453395
Snektron
daurnimator, i mean why would i shrink memory with realloc

1582453403
daurnimator
Snektron: e.g. you have an hashmap have removed some entries: you may want to give up some space back to the OS; but if it fails, you don't mind and having extra space is fine

1582453417
daurnimator
Snektron: the key point is: realloc is allowed to fail; shrink is not allowed to

1582453444
Snektron
mikdusan, it looks like its actually not recompiling the entire think, just 146 objects

1582453515
Snektron
daurninator, but why would i call the function thats allowed to fail instead of the one thats not allowed to fail?

1582453543
daurnimator
Snektron: because it could be faster.

1582453567
Snektron
ah, thats a valid reason

1582453601
daurnimator
also: shrink might "not fail" by just lieing about freeing the memory

1582453677
Snektron
anyway, suppose i have a c function that accepts a parameter via a c vararg. Can i `extern` that function in zig?

1582453696
Snektron
Its about mremap in this case, it accepts an optional parameter

1582453703
daurnimator
Snektron: uh..... sometimes: sometimes it works; other times I've gotten errors with TODOs in them

1582453712
Snektron
hm

1582453758
Snektron
Should i just use the syscall regardless of whether c is linked?

1582453779
Snektron
s/c/libc/

1582453787
daurnimator
no?

1582453803
daurnimator
Are you sure its actually a vararg and not a weird thing like open() ?

1582453816
Snektron
no its really a vararg

1582453859
daurnimator
looks like a weird thing like open() to me

1582453892
Snektron
`extern void *mremap (void *__addr, size_t __old_len, size_t __new_len, int __flags, ...) __THROW;` (from sys/mman.h)

1582453896
mikdusan
Snektron: another hint: I manually set some random .cpp files in zig's source tree to a future timestamp in '2021. It rebuilds them everytime.

1582453947
daurnimator
Snektron: but I have a hunch it will "just work" for you anyway

1582453961
daurnimator
Snektron: give it a go :)

1582454056
Snektron
daurninator, i see what you mean with the weird think like open, but im not sure whats the difference between a c vararg that is used as optional or used as an actual vararg

1582454299
Snektron
mikdusan, i think i'm just going to live with it for now

1582454346
mikdusan
if you have an idea which source .h/.cpp files are being recompiled, take a long listing and eyeball their timestamps

1582454349
mikdusan
but ok

1582454424
Snektron
yeah but like i said, its not limited to zig

1582454548
Snektron
hmm, looks like lld

1582454625
Snektron
time stamps arent in the future or anything

1582454954
mikdusan
yeah but it could be any file in the dep chain that causes this. llvm headers, libs, whatever. anyhow, I'll leave it at that; this smells like a timetsamp issue

1582454990
Snektron
I've just enabled ZIG_FORCE_EXTERNAL_LLD so that it skips building LLD, that saves enough time such that its not as bothersome

1582455059
Snektron
daurnimator, it didn't work. I suspect its because the last parameter of mremap is a pointer

1582455076
daurnimator
Snektron: can you share the code?

1582455153
Snektron
ah, nevermind, i passed a zig type instead of a pointer

1582455198
mikdusan
Snektron: assuming no network mounts search from root and if that comes back empty then I lead you on a wild goose chase: (touch now.txt; find / -newer now.txt)

1582455303
Snektron
that returns a whole bunch of /proc and /sys paths

1582455316
mikdusan
`find /home /usr` should do it

1582455454
Snektron
nothing apart from some misconfigured directory permissions which don't coincide with anything related to zig

1582455475
mikdusan
I'm out of ideas :(

1582455546
Snektron
well with the cmake flag it at least its not so bad now, and i'll probably need to get a new laptop soon-ish anyway so its fine. Thanks for the help

1582456312
daurnimator
Snektron: I assume you'll send a PR to the std lib?

1582456352
Snektron
Yes

1582472219

dimenus: mem.len

1582472346

dimenus: see also

1582473167

daurnimator: do you know if we have an error-save (so no checked ub) float-to-int cast?

1582473188
daurnimator
mq32: no idea

1582473215
daurnimator
when is the behaviour undefined?

1582473230
daurnimator
and do you mean a bitcast or an actual conversion

1582473233
mq32
conversion

1582473242
mq32
@floatToInt will panic when the float is out-of-range or is a non-integer value

1582473252
mq32
we have std.math.cast, but that will only cast integers

1582479474
jessermeyer
Are types and their properties supposed to be reported in PDBs?

1582479488
jessermeyer
Visual Studio knows what type a declaration is, but it doesn't know what the type itself is.

frett27_
Note that programs using C++ object files must always be linked with g++, in order to supply the appropriate C++ libraries. Attempting to link a C++ object file with the C compiler gcc will cause "undefined reference" errors for C++ standard library functions

Wanting to get a hunch from folks here before spinning up an Issue on the repo.

1582484768
pixelherodev
I'd report the issue

1582484787
jessermeyer
Roger that.

1582484804
jessermeyer
BTW, anyone following the ALSR discussion on the PIE issue?  Am I off base?

1582485075
jessermeyer
ALSR for buffer overrun protection strikes me as extremely heavy handed compared to alternatives, but I cannot deny the benefit.

1582485099
andrewrk
ASLR is standard in most linux distributions

1582485123
andrewrk
I think it's an appropriate default for ReleaseSafe mode

1582485284
jessermeyer
If the goal is to adhere to standards, whatever they are, then there isn't much room for discussion.

1582485413
andrewrk
I think you misunderstand me

1582485475
andrewrk
being standard in most linux distributions is an argument for ASLR not being too heavy handed, and for it being an appropriate default for ReleaseSafe mode

1582485873
jessermeyer
'Too heavy handed' is with reference to the threat model when ASLR was implemented, which was before spectre, meltdown, etc.

1582486073
jessermeyer
I would be shocked if the Linux kernel would have invested in ALSR if it knew its value would be limited to buffer overruns.  It was designed for a different problem.

1582486091
jessermeyer
I expect to see ASLR rolled back over time, or until the cache model for modern CPUs changes somehow.

1582486297
andrewrk
I do not expect to see this

1582486781
jessermeyer
What do the impacts of that paper tell you about the viability of ASLR as a security measure?

1582486853
shakesoda
got dear imgui working in my zig sandbox with cimgui

1582486865
shakesoda
didn't run into anything weird with integrating the c++ stuff in the build

1582486894
shakesoda
now i can think instead about making something useful show up on screen ;)

1582486917
jessermeyer
nice!

1582487127
andrewrk
jessermeyer, ASLR was never understood to be foolproof. it's a hardening measure

1582487185
andrewrk
the exploit in that article requires ability to run turing complete code in a sandbox, btw, which is not always available to an attacker. one might even say rarely available to an attacker

1582487362
jessermeyer
My argument is that its hardening measure is substantially less in the presence of these exploits.

1582487395
jessermeyer
Agreed. The article is specific to web browser security.

1582487440
jessermeyer
I'm not well versed on what to assume attacker capabilities are.  No idea.

1582487481
jessermeyer
But if an attacker is leveraging a buffer overflow (which comes from the discussion in the thread), we are in a turing complete scenario, so I think we can assume that capability, I think for Zig broadly.

1582487540
gchristensen
[citation needed]

1582487553
jessermeyer
For which claim?

1582487561
gchristensen
buffer overflow -> turing complete

1582487642
jessermeyer
I forget how many bytes of overrun you need to take complete control of the execution pipeline.  I recall Chandler Carruth specifying this in one of this security talks ... Let me find that.

1582487703
andrewrk
typically as an attacker you need to hard code a (correct) address when exploiting a buffer

1582487757
jessermeyer
Yes, which AFAIK, can be determined with this new side channel attack.

1582487773
jessermeyer
Or are you saying you need a turing machine to run the attack in the first place?

1582488062
gchristensen
that attack seems to require turing completeness in the uncompromised environment to pull off

1582488108
gchristensen
most buffer overflow attacks are much less exotic and aslr is an effective solution

1582488162
gchristensen
I'm looking forward to processors implementing capability-based security, revoking the authority to jump to those pointers -- like that early experimental intel chip.

1582488510
jessermeyer
Thanks for the discussion on this topic.  Things for me to think and read more about.

1582489252
jessermeyer
I can't find where Carruth made his claims about turing complete attacks, but I did find the related paper.  Reading it.

I don't know how these results from 2007 have survived, and how they are to be considered in light of side-channel attacks.

'... argument applies to the interaction between our techniques and address space layoutrandomization (ASLR). Those gadgets that do not require knowledge of addresses on the stack canbe used directly in the Shacham et al. [26] derandomization framework.  Some of those gadgets thatdo require knowledge of addresses on the stack could likely be

whats the deal with std.Mutex.deinit()? all 3 defs of it in std/mutex.zig have the same `self.* = undefined;` no-op-ish logic

wouldnt like to turn all my `defer held.release()`s into `defer { held.release(); held.deinit(); }` if it's not ever actually going to do any

In safe mode, it’ll set the memory to 0xaaaaaa and probably crash if it’s reused

fengb: makes sense thx

i don't think requiring a mutable reference for deinit is a good idea

1582495160
mq32
this enforces variables that never be mutated to be non-const

1582498292
andrewrk
mq32, deinitializing them is mutation

1582498324
andrewrk
metaleap, zig's safety features do not yet take advantage of this, but there are quite a few things where setting things to undefined will activate safety protections

1582498351
andrewrk
for example, branching on undefined. `x = undefined; if (x) ` will cause a safety panic

sounds good

hm. maybe i think too c++y for this...

it seems reasonable to keep it mutable in the scope you own it and pass it around as const if needed

1582498501
shakesoda
that's what i've been doing

seems natural enough?

suppose somebody gives you a nested anonymous struct like so .{ .{ 1, 2, 3 }, .{ 4, 5, 6 } } into a var parameter. How do I detect properties about it's length and element type?

1582499452
adamkowalski
do I need to look at the type info and check the fields to see if each one is of the same type, and count the number of fields?

1582501494
metaleap
adamkowalski: yes. `inline for (@typeInfo(@TypeOf(my_var_arg)).Struct.fields)`

hey andrewrk do you know what kind of insane bullshit hackery would be needed to get Zig to build binaries that TempleOS can use?

also write your own syscall wrapper with a freestanding target
